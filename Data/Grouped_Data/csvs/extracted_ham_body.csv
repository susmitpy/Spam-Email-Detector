I run exmh routinely from home (broadband) using an XWindows Client tunneled through ssh under <ahem> WinXP.  It works very well in this fashion.

FWIW, I use Eudora under Winder$ because it's less of a virus magnet.  :)

There's more to the story why I run Winder$, but that's really off-topic and I'm already guilty!

The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

I noticed that after upgrading to 2.41 (or 2.50) from 2.31, the -F
option was removed from spamd. 

This is fine because all of the HTML format mail seems to arrive
properly. However, messages that get tagged as Spam arrive as just html
source.

Is there any way around this? I would like all HTML/RTF messages to
retain their formatting even if they are flagged as spam. I would
accomplish this on 2.31 by using the ""-F 0"" flag when starting spamd.

Thanks!

alk] procmail help,"I'm fairly confused here, with Procmail. 
I know this isn't a procmail list per-se; feel free to answer my questions in 
private email to r_gilmanhunt@hotp.com.  

I've looked for web-stuff to answer this question but I can't find anything 
specific on this scenario.

Here's the situation. 
I have a global /etc/procmailrc file. It works, and when I insert stuff into 
it for logging (LOGFILE=/root/procmail.log, VERBOSE=yeah. LOGABSTRACT=all) it 
shows up where I expect it to (the log in /root/procmail.log)  At the end of 
this file, I use 
 :0fw
 | spamc
to call spamassassin.

Also in it is a carboncopy recipe (yes, I know, it's one of the evils we do 
for our corporate masters)  (at the top) (to their credit, I am instructed 
that they are not interested in the actual contents, but are concerned about 
future lawsuits and their culpability, so they want a record made. Discussion 
on this point is immaterial)
:0
  * ? test -d $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR || mkdir -p --mode=750 $ARCHIVEDIR/$DATEDIR
  { }
:0 c
 $SAVEAT

I have several users where I forward certain spams to /dev/null  . . .their 
procmailrc file (/home/$user/.procmailrc) looks like this:
:0
  * ^From: .*spermfun.com
  /dev/null

Now I've got a person who needs a copy of her inbound emails sent to another 
email address (outside the company), so I've got this recipe in her 
/home/$user/.procmailrc file:
:0 c
  !user@domain.tld

It almost looks like procmail's not running a user's copy recipe after a 
global copy recipe, except that I can replace that user's one with 
:0 
 * ^Subject: .*test
  procmail.holder
and get the same result.

The result, to put it succinctly, is ""nothing"". No forwards go out, no files 
are made, if I try to log information, no logs are set up. I've modified the 
user/group and permissions to match known-working recipes (the spermfun 
example above) and still nothing.  However, I can redirect those other 
messages.  In other words- just this user's procmailrc file is not working- 
other users have no problems.

Any suggestions would be helpful :)

This feature, excerpted from Wolfgang Engel's ShaderX book from Wordware 
Publishing, presents a simple shader trick that performs a good per pixel 
approximation of a non-integer power function. The technique works for input 
values between 0 and 1 and supports large exponents. The presented shader does 
not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend 
more instructions in order to decrease the error or to reach greater exponents.

As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If

MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.

Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify 
""nomime"" => 1?

Evangelicals' threat to new archbishop

Direct action threat over liberal views on sexuality

Stephen Bates, religious affairs correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Evangelical fundamentalists last night stepped up their campaign to oust
Rowan Williams, the incoming Archbishop of Canterbury, before he even takes
up his post, by threatening to take ""direct action"" against him.
The council of the Church Society, the Church of England's oldest
evangelical body, joined a younger evangelical pressure group called Reform,
which is also opposed to Dr Williams, in calling on him to recant his
supposedly liberal views on sexuality or stand down.
Following an emergency meeting, the 167-year-old society, whose leaders met
the archbishop last week, proclaimed their continued opposition to his
appointment and called on all Anglicans to spurn him.
The move is the latest stage of an increasingly aggressive attempt to
destabilise the new archbishop, whose leftwing political views are regarded
with deep suspicion by the conservative fringes of the evangelical movement.
Some evangelicals object to Dr Williams's acknowledgement that he has
ordained a gay priest, something many bishops have done, and that those who
have sex outside marriage need not necessarily be spurned. The new
archbishop has repeatedly assured them that he respects the canons of the
church.
Nevertheless, the society said: ""It is clear that he prefers his private
judgment to the voice of scripture, to the voice of tradition and to the
common mind of the church. As such he can only be a focus of disunity.
""The council... called upon loyal Anglicans to pray specifically that Rowan
Williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand
down,"" it said.
The society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on
bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide Anglican communion, of
which archbishops of Canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from
Dr Williams's doctrinal and ethical position. It promised it would be
""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"".
It added that Dr Williams remained on the editorial board of a journal
called Theology and Sexuality which, six months ago, published articles
allegedly commending homosexual behaviour.
Despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the
church. Dr Williams, currently Archbishop of Wales, was chosen by the crown
appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his
appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the Queen.
He is due to succeed George Carey, who retires this month, and will be
formally enthroned at Canterbury cathedral in February.
Asked what form direct action might take, the Rev George Curry, the
society's chairman, said: ""Watch this space."" Presumably it could involve a
small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking
alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where Dr Williams
is present.
Church of England bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down
during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the
evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the
absence of a robust rebuttal.
A letter by senior theologians in today's Guardian, however, repudiates the
evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical
teaching.
On the BBC's Thought for the Day yesterday, Angela Tilby, vice-principal of
Westcott House, Cambridge, accused Dr Williams's opponents of presumption
and blackmail. ""It is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. It is
attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get
your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said.
Last week, Dr Williams said he was deeply saddened. ""Matters of sexuality
should not have the priority or centrality that Reform and the Church
Society have tried to give them. The archbishop cannot withdraw his
appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take
the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under God.""

ematics film-festival in October in Berkeley,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516333
Date: Not supplied

All through October, Berkeley's Mathematical Sciences Research Institute is 
hosting Cinemath, a mathematics film festival: 

    Permutations and Configurations: A Calculated Cinema 

    In this avant-garde subset of Cinemath, we explore films that have been 
    constructed using mathematical concepts both simple and complex- geometric 
    permutations, musical frameworks, even topography are among the strategies 
    that have been employed to compose and sequence film frames. Filmmakers 
    such as Oskar Fischinger and Walther Ruttmann created some of the earliest 
    avant-garde films by multiplying, dividing, and otherwise transforming 
    abstract images- including spirals, rectangles, and circles to produce 
    dynamic rhythms and harmonies. Today such visual music and motion graphics 
    are the currency of digital graphics. Anthony McCall's film performances 
    such as Line Describing a Cone create 3-D geometric shapes into which the 
    viewer can literally step. We also explore films by pioneers of 
    machine-generated and computer-produced animation (Norman McLaren, James 
    and John Whitney, Stan Vanderbeek) as well as works by contemporary 
    animators who use the computer to either generate or pattern images (Larry 
    Cuba, Paul Glabicki, James Otis). Peter Kubelka, Taka Iimura, and Standish 
    Lawder use the frame as the unit with which they create editing patterns, 
    while Kurt Kren and Paul Sharits reckon on arithmetic systems to variously 
    calculate compositional or editing patterns. Bette Gordon, Hollis Frampton, 
    and Bruce Elder figure in algorithms, group theory, and set theory to 
    graphically enliven the frame or to structure their films. While no 
    mathematical knowledge is required to enjoy these films, we count on you to 
    try to calculate the mathematical systems employed!

Pg 177:
In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
official residence had a recorded title.  It did not.

Pg 92:
The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
as high as US$3,000.

==========

I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't
correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,
in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)

==>

The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
under Lorenzo the Magnificent?
 

--------------

De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they
don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally.

 fun with the PTC,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85378428
Date: Not supplied

I received some feedback in email (from several of you actually) regarding my 
earlier blog about the Parents Television Council[1], which recently published 
a report in which they labeled Buffy as the worst show on television for 
children. Let me clarify why this organization bothers me so much.

Buffy as a show is clearly inappropriate for children under 12, and a game like 
GTA3 is as well. The PTC, however, has a clear agenda that goes beyond simply 
warning parents about the dangers of television shows or video games. There is 
a belief on the part of the PTC that the hour from 8-9pm (the first hour of 
primetime) must be designated a family hour, and that no offensive shows should 
air during that time. I don't believe that it's the networks' responsibility to 
restrict the kind of content aired during a particular hour of television. The 
shows that air during primetime run the gamut; some are family-oriented and 
some aren't. There is, however, no shortage of suitable content should parents 
and children wish to watch TV together during this hour.

It should be the parent's responsibility to police a child's television 
viewing. If you don't want your kids watching _Buffy the Vampire Slayer_, then 
don't let them, but don't campaign to have the show removed from the air or 
shoved into a late hour that would only result in its cancellation just because 
you don't like its content. If you don't think a show is appropriate, don't let 
your kids watch it.

The PTC also seems to find shows offensive that are family-oriented. An example 
of one such show is _Malcolm in the Middle_. I would hardly call this show 
inappropriate for kids. Apparently the only shows that the PTC deems 
appropriate are those that have been sanitized to match their 
ultra-conservative agenda. Even then, I wouldn't really mind, but the idea that 
all other shows must be relegated to some later hour is just ludicrous.

I don't know if there's a sendmail-ish way (it's not in the -d0.1 output),
but this should work:

If you get a long list of function/message looking phrases, milter

First off , my 8 year old has been singing them since she was 6. Second
off, these are much easier to rip to divx and mp3. Third, new songs,
remastered originals and other dvd goodies. Its a 2 dvd set so its well
worth the 17$ we paid for it.

I am using SpamAssassin as part of the MailScanner package (using sendmail

with SA. All very neat.

I thought that SA rated a message with a certain score, then did a certain
action (such as store | deliver | delete) based on the configuration given.
I was hoping there were some other actions that I could custom-program in.

Again, many thanks,

"ve American economics (was Re: sed /s/United States/Roman
    Empire/g)","
I wanted to get back to this but didn't have the time.  I actually lived on
a couple different Indian reservations growing up in the Pacific Northwest
and also spent a fair amount time in Lakota/Sioux country as well.  And my
parents have lived on an even more diverse range of Indian reservations than
I have (my experience being a direct result of living with my parents).  I
do get a lot of my information first-hand, or in some cases, second-hand
from my father.

The income figures for the Indians are somewhat misleading, mostly because
it is really hard to do proper accounting of the effective income.  While it
is true that some Indians live in genuine poverty, it is typically as a
consequence of previous poor decisions that were made by the tribe, not
something that was impressed upon them.

The primary problem with the accounting is that there is a tribal entity
that exists separately from the individuals, typically an ""Indian
Corporation"" of one type or another where each member of the tribe owns a
single share (the details of when and how a share becomes active varies from
tribe to tribe).  In most tribes, a dividend is paid out to each of the
tribal members from the corporation, usually to the tune of $10-30k per
person, depending on the tribe.  The dividend money comes from a number of
places, with the primary sources being the Federal Gov't and various
businesses/assets owned by the Indian corporation.

You have to understand a couple things:  First, a great many Indian tribes
are run as purely communist enterprises.  Everyone gets a check for their
share no matter what.  One of the biggest problems this has caused is very
high unemployment (often 70-90%) for tribal members, who are more than happy
take their dividend and not work.  The dividend they receive from the
corporation often constitutes their sole ""income"" for government accounting
purposes.  Unfortunately, to support this type of economics when no one
works, they've had to sell off most of their useful assets to maintain those
dividends.  Many of the tribes genuinely living in poverty do so because
they have run out of things to sell yet nobody works.  One of the ironies is
that on many of the reservations where the tribes still have assets to burn,
many of the people working in the stores and such are actually poor white
folk, not Indians.

Second, even though the tribe members each get a cash dividend, they also
receive an enormous range of benefits and perks from the Indian corporation
to the tune of tens of thousands of dollars per person annually.  By
benefits and perks, we are talking about the kinds of things no other
ordinary American receives from either their employer or the government.

It should be pointed out that while many of these Indian corporations are
ineptly run, and mostly provide sinecures for other Indians, a minority are
very smartly managed and a few hire non-Indian business executives with good
credentials to run their business divisions.  An example of this is the
Haida Corporation, which while having less 1,000 tribal shareholders, has
billions of dollars in assets and the various corporations they own have
gross revenues in the $200-300 million range (and growing).  Yet the
dividend paid out is strictly controlled, about $20k in this particular
case, and they engaged in a practice of waiting a couple decades before
drawing money from any of the assets they were granted which has led to
intelligent investment and use.  They don't eat their seed corn, and have
actually managed to grow their stash.  In contrast, a couple islands over,
there is another tribe of ~2,000 people that has a net loss of about $50
million annually IIRC while being regularly endowed by the Federal
government with several billions of dollars in valuable assets.  This
particular tribe has a modest income in theory, but the actual expenditures
per person annually is in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, and many
borrow money against future income.  Incidentally, in this particular case,
the people that ARE working frequently pull in a few hundred thousand
dollars a year, much of which goes back to the tribal corporation rather
than their own pockets.

Somewhat annoying, the Federal government semi-regularly grants valuable
assets to these tribes when they've burned through the ones previously given
where feasible, typically selling the assets to American or foreign
companies.  And the cycle continues.

So what is the primary problem for the tribes that have problems?  In a
nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society.

Few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant.  Incest, rape, and
gross promiscuity is rampant.  Inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during
pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very
substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded.  Many of
the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the
earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above.  On one
reservation my parents lived, the HIV infection rate was >70%.  Many of
these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is
arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police
etc).

In short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a
shambles because they have become THE most pathological societies that I
have ever seen anywhere.  Because of their legal status, there really aren't
that many consequences for their behavior.  There are many things that I
could tell you that I've seen that you probably would not believe unless
you'd seen it yourself.  There are always good people in these tribes, but
it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good
guys by a fair margin many times, and this IS a mobocracy typically.  (BTW,
if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as
a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are
openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up Indian reservations.  It
will give you an interesting perspective on things.)

There are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous
Indians.  The first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and
intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely.  The second is
where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if
they maintain their tribal identity.  In both of these cases, the tribal
leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological
cases mentioned above.

The Indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent
by the tribe per capita.  And the actual reportable income is quite high
when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole.  It is
just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to
ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income.  The
poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic.  This was my
original point.


On a tangent:

One thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasi-tribal
corporate socialism.  Many Indian tribes implement a type of corporate
socialism that is mind-bogglingly bad in execution.  That they use this
structure at all is an accident of history more than anything.  But what has
interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well
over the long run.  It is like a Family Corporation writ large.

It seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly
voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general Western
society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with
the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of self-selecting
individuals.

Damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer.

 Your Gods,"Hindus mourn 'monkey god'


By Omer Farooq
BBC reporter in Hyderabad

Hundreds of people have attended the funeral of a monkey which became
revered as a divine incarnation of a Hindu god in the southern Indian
state of Andhra Pradesh.


The monkey was quite old and both its hind legs were paralysed

Animal rights campaigners say the monkey died of starvation and exhaustion
after being trapped in a temple for a month by over-zealous worshippers.

The animal was cremated in Anantapur district, 400 kilometres (250 miles)
south of the state capital, Hyderabad, on Sunday.

It had not eaten for three weeks.

Last rites were performed by priests in the village of Timmiganipally in
the presence of hundreds of devotees who had come to believe that the
monkey was a reincarnation of the Hindu monkey god, Hanuman.

Garlanded

One animal rights activist said his group's efforts to save the monkey had
failed because of the blind faith of the people.


The monkey's death came a day after he and others tried to move the animal
out of the temple, but were prevented by villagers.

The monkey, which was found perched on top of an idol of Hanuman a month
ago, attracted hundreds of devotees every day from surrounding villages,
as well as from the neighbouring state of Karnataka.

Devotees showered the monkey with fruit and flowers and worshipped it
around the clock.

'Exploited'

Locals said they believed that Lord Hanuman was visiting the village, as
the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of
residents.

But animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being
mistreated.

They filed a petition in the state's High Court saying the monkey had been
forcibly confined in the temple.

The group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being
exploited to make money.

The court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey - but
villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.

I haven't been to Van in years, but I do know that in Toronto, outside
of the small deeply ethnic neighbourhoods, if you stray more than 50
feet from Wellesley and Jarvis or Queen and Spadina, you're in
doughnutland; there's far more like the eateries in the Eaton Centre
than there are quaint cafes like McCaul north of Dundas, and the rare

When most of Toronto does not live in those neighbourhoods but instead
lives in Scarborough, Malton, Mississauga and Markham (franchisevilles), you
will quickly see that one or two trendy strips does not save an entire
nation.

The astounding thing about java is that despite all of the many significant

I was really looking forward to being able to use a better language like 
java and get it compiled to real platform-specific binaries via the GNU 
compiler collection.   But this seems to have never really gotten anywhere 
because it would require porting or reimplementing libraries, which are 
probably not source-available or tolerably licenced.   When I looked at 
what I had to do to gcc and link ""hello world,"" I lost interest.

Who the hell is writing the runtimes, anyway?   Why are Perl/Python/Ruby 
more reliable?   In a world where the Macs all ran emulated 68K code 
utterly reliably, it's just hard to accept that there can't be a single 
portable JVM that just works.

My opinion is biased because of the disgraceful state of non-Windoze

I have to agree here.  If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not
support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.

A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all
its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their

Newsletters won't use the mark.  Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor
of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

Sorry, that just can't work.

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,
and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.

Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.

Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
everybody has to pay them for.

The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.

[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.

yption approach to secure web applications,"Hi everybody!

I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database 
access with postgreSQL).

This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a 
framework for other web applications.

The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.

I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the 
database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.

Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.

A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for 
encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), 
and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. 

I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not 
the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the 
database, but the database is accessible from the web application. 
Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the 
database password, I can use a different database with different 
user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.

Where I can found good documentation about this topic?

There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I 
thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. 
After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to 
learn methods and technics.

First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so 
I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach 
could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user 
(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the 
nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory 
or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.

The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in 
the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small 
bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source 
is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the 
db connection/password to the main web application.

In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in 
shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user 
account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your 
provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java 
application (that means, really, another server running in the 
background).

Any suggestions?

Thank you,
Mario Torre

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro

NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.

That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.

Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.

The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.

No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.

The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.

When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.

Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
groups.

But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

advocacy management and communications software company. Larry Purpuro,

for the Los Angeles Times.

tokenize() couldn't be easier to use:  it takes a string argument, and
produces a stream of tokens (whether via explicit list, or generator, or
tuple, or ... doesn't matter).  All the tokenize() functions in GBayes.py
and timtest.py are freely interchangeable this way.

Note that we have no evidence to support that a customizable tokenizer would
do any good, or, if it would, in which ways customization could be helpful.
That's a research issue on which no work has been done.

That's partly a failure of imagination <wink>.  Splitting out all knowledge
of tokenization is just a large block cut-and-paste ... there, it's done.
Change the

    from timtoken import tokenize

at the top to use any other tokenizer now.  If you want to make it easier
still, feel free to check in something better.

> messages and tokenize each one.

The Msg and MsgStream classes in timtest.py are a start at that, but it's
hard to do anything truly *useful* here when people use all sorts of
different physical representations for email msgs (mboxes in various
formats, one file per ""folder"", one file per msg, Skip's gzipped gimmick,
...).  If you're a Python coder <wink>, you *should* find it very easy to
change the guts of Msg and MsgStream to handle your peculiar scheme.
Defining interfaces for these guys should be done.

This sounds like a bottomless pit to me, and there's no easier way to
customize than to edit the code.  As README.txt still says, though, massive
refactoring would help.  Hop to it!

Date: 2002-10-06T18:12:51+01:00

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code

' intestines and pigs' teeth,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85497383

This is the headline of the month, possibly the year: ""Doctors Grow Pig Teeth 
in Rat Intestines."" Do we even need to read the story to understand it? It's 
like a freaking _haiku_ of near-singularity, future-shocky wonderment! 

    U.S. doctors said on Thursday they have managed to grow living pig teeth in 
    rats, a feat of biotechnology that experts said could spark a dental 
    revolution. 

    Researchers at Boston's Forsyth Institute said their successful experiment 
    suggests the existence of dental stem cells, which could one day allow a 
    person to replace a lost tooth with an identical one grown from his or her 
    own cells. 

    ""The ability to identify, isolate and propagate dental stem cells to use in 
    biological replacement tooth therapy has the potential to revolutionize 
    dentistry,"" said Dominick DePaola, president and CEO of the institute that 
    focuses on oral and facial science.

The problem is that ""--with <foo> --without <bar>"" is clearly not meant to
change deeply the way a package is built. Its use would be more like
enabling/disabling gpg, ldap, whateversql support in packages as it's not
possible to use something like ""--with-<foo>=<bar>"" which could be used for
a much wider scope.

    filed lawsuits in U.S. District Court in Miami in June and July against 
    Dallas- based Southwest and Dallas-based American Airlines under the 
    Americans with Disabilities Act. They are doing so under an untested legal 
    theory. Namely, that ADA provisions on the accessibility of public 
    accommodations to the disabled apply to Internet Web sites just as they do 
    to brick-and-mortar facilities like movie theaters and department stores. 

Five months ago, I said[3] &#8220;within the next 12 months, all web authoring 
tools will fully embrace CSS, accessibility, and web standards. And I mean 
fully, inside and out, as Macromedia appears to have done here [with 
Dreamweaver MX]. Those tools that do not will simply fall by the wayside. This 
is the new baseline.&#8221; Seven months to go on that prediction. Tick tock,

photo opportunity when I was in the airport a couple of weeks ago, and saw 
someone checking on a standup bass fiddle. It was in a huge plastic Darth Vader 
shipping case. The _buckles_ on the thing were about the size of my uke. I 
should have taken a picture of my uke and the bass side-by-side. Anyway, here's 
a stand-up bass that looks much more portable: the Kona Walkingstick. You still

exmh bug?,"
The way to debug something like this is to turn on the log (Preferences 
-> Hacking Support -> Debug log enabled) and track the gpg commands 
being issued and the responses.

FWIW, using exmh 2.5 and gpg 1.0.7 I do not have problems sending 
encrypted messages to myself. When I select the message, an xterm 
window pops up asking for the passphrase. I don't recall exmh ever 
asking me for the passphrase from the tty that started exmh nor from a 
dialog box. (But then again, I'm not a heavy gpg user).

I guess it's time to reveal the incredibly kind invitation I received[1]. As 
many of you may have found out or guessed, I will be attending oral argument 
for the Eldred case[2] before the Supreme Court. 

I'm incredibly excited, as you might imagine. Visiting the Supreme Court would 
be quite enough, but seeing such an important case...Dayenu! When Lessig asked 
me if I was free that day to come, I laughed because I couldn't (and still 
can't) think of anything I'd rather do than attend. I am eternally grateful to 
Lessig for the chance to attend. On the other hand, I'm sort of embarassed to 
have the opportunity, when there are surely others who deserve it far more than 
me. Luckily, it seems that such deserving others will be able to get seats by 
camping in line with us. 

So, I'll be arriving in D.C. on Tuesday, attending an 
Eldred/Duke/EPIC/Bookmobile superparty, and then camping in line with Seth 
Schoen[3], Lisa Rein, Jace Cooke but unfortunately not Cory Doctorow. If you'd 
like to come with us, let me know. 

I was hoping I'd be able to take notes and post them to my weblog for those who 
couldn't make it, but as I read in today's Times, only lawyers and those with 
official press credentials are allowed to take notes![4] I think this is 
outrageous, but hopefully I will be able to remember enough to provide an 
interesting account. 

In a related irony, today was ""Disney Day"" at Borders[5], where they played 
Disney rock songs with the volume turned up too loud, disturbing my usual habit 
of reading a book there. However, I did manage to skim through _The Practice of 
Programming_. 

In an unrelated note, if you haven't been electrocuted by a Model T spark plug, 
I highly recommend it.

Ubi China had always wanted to make a PC game for the local market, but a 
number to factors kept the idea on hold. In January 2001, the right incentive 
to motivate Ubi China to try a local project finally arrived: the license for 
""Music Up"", a popular animated property.

  | 1) Right click on the folder label in the folder list

That (the way I have it configured, and it sounds as if the way Tony does
too) just does a move (rather than select as target without moving).

Of course, if you can manage to get no messages currently selected, then
it works fine.

  | 2) In the main window, the ""+"" key puts you into a ""change 
  |    folder"" mode (the first time you use it after starting exmh),
  |    hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few
  |    characters of the folder name and hit space for autocomplete.

This works, but is not nice if you're not using the keyboard, but just
the mouse.

Tony: I agree - a nice way to link in one click would be good, and should
be easy to add, though currently adding mouse bindings (something like
shift right click would be a good choice) is much harder than adding
key bindings.

But note there's no need to ""undo"" - the way I generally use link, if
the desired destination folder isn't the current selected target, is
to right click on the target, which selects it and moves the message,
(and because I have the ""automatic move to the next message on move or
link option set) select the message again, and then ""Link"".

Exmh only permits one uncomitted action to be selected for a message at a
time, that is, one of delete, move, or link.   Selecting any of those
implicitly undoes any previous choice from the three (so you cannot
achieve a ""move"" by doing a link, then delete, then commit, it needs to
be link, commit, delete, commit).  (xmh was just the same there incidentally).

  | How's spring shaping up ""down under""?

No meaningful comment from me, I'm not there at the minute.   But I'm told
that where I'm from it is cold, wet, and miserable, though has been better
during the day (sunny days, cold nights) for the past few.    In any case,
all of that is a good enough reason to stay away...

Well, I don't really find it consistent at all to use an rpm package built
against something that wasn't installed through rpm :-/

What I'd recommend in your case : You should keep at least one original Red
Hat Linux kernel (you do just in case, right? ;-)) and install the matching
alsa-kernel package as you'll need at least one because of the
dependencies. Then for your custom built kernel, simply ""./configure
--with-cards=all && make && make install DESTDIR=/tmp/alsa-driver"" from the
alsa-driver sources then as root copy all the modules under
/tmp/alsa-driver/lib/modules/ to your modules dir and run ""depmod -a"".

Of course you can even make it much faster by not compiling all un-needed
drivers, as I guess that's one of the reasons one would rebuild his own
kernel.

I find this the easiest and cleanest way to get around the problem. It's
what I've done and what I'll keep doing on my laptop where I'm running a
kernel recompiled with ACPI.

Clearing	Framework

Reply-To: <dgcchat@lists.goldmoney.com>

I'm happy to announce the first public release of NeuDist

NeuDist is an Open Source Software framework for building applications
for the Neubia Distributed Clearing Platform.

This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would
primarily be of interest to developers.

Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented
towards people with experience in Java/XML development.

There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available
in the next release.

The framework currently contains the following:
- Classes for creating ""Named Objects"", which are authenticated using
digital signatures within a hierarchy.
- Storage framework for ""Named Objects"".
- Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet
interoperable with other implementations)
- Simple SOAP client
- Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on ""Named
  Objects"".
- Current types of ""Named Objects"" include:
    NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication
 	Framework
    AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using
	digital signatures.


Next major release is scheduled to contain:
 - Core:
	hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level 	NameSpaces
 - Signing Services:
	Implementation of web based signing services
	End user hosted signing service
 - Example User Authentication Application
 - Example Payment System based on NeuDist

I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will
cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher
level documentation about the business side of things.

Read more about NeuDist or download our early version at
http://neudist.org

Too early IMO (if you mean to leave the various other tools out of
it).  If and when we package this, perhaps we should use Barry's trick
from the email package for making the package itself the toplevel dir
of the distribution (rather than requiring an extra directory level
just so the package can be a subdir of the distro).

For goddess' sake Martin that seems to be exactly what you're doing.  You 
started your reply to Tim's posting of the Guardian article by suggesting that 
it was factually inaccurate.  Did you actually read it or did you just assume 
that if the Grauniad writes about a Muslim extremist they must be making him out

Always nice to have one to put stuff that overrides RH things. Like if
you absolutely detest qt and some programs are rebuildable from sources
with different %configure options. You can get src.rpm, edit spec, bump
release numberwith your initials and another number and rebuild, insert
into apt and let loose... :)

Doesn't freshrpms have updates dir too? Maybe not quite as up to date as
up2date but still. I would never use up2date. There is another
repository at apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org IIRC. Not sure if that had The
updates.

mated forwarding,"
Hi Folks,

I've been trying to set a button called which automatically
forwards mail using a '-form mycomps' without going through
the editor, but so far haven't got the right recipe.

I currently have in my .exmh-defaults:

*Mops.spam.text:        Spam
*Mops.spam.command:     Msg_Forward -form spamcomps -noedit -nowhatnowproc ; Msg
_Remove


I've also tried with ""SeditSend {$draft $t 0}"" after the forward command.
It should forward to a spam address (where filters get adjusted) and then
delete.  It does so, but not without producing the edit window.

Any help appreciated.

yption approach to secure web applications,"Hi everybody!

I'm writing a web application in java (tomcat + jsp/servlets + database 
access with postgreSQL).

This will be released under the GPL and will eventually be useful as a 
framework for other web applications.

The application main focus is e-commerce, but not limited to that.

I would like to use some form of cryptography to protect data on the 
database, but I have some problem figuring out the right approach.

Above all, how to store passwords and keys in a shared web server.

A problem that I was unable to solve is how to store keys for 
encryption/decryption. The api that I'm using is the jca (jdk1.4.x), 
and the methods of saving generated keys in keystores fails always. 

I can serialize the object, and store in the database, but this is not 
the most secure approach: this key is needed to decrypt data in the 
database, but the database is accessible from the web application. 
Assuming that I can find a good and secure place where to store the 
database password, I can use a different database with different 
user... Argh... to complex and doesn't really solve the problem.

Where I can found good documentation about this topic?

There is another approach that I would share with the list, something I 
thought that can be of bit interest, but probabily wrong and insecure. 
After all, I'm a real beginner in secure programming, and I'm here to 
learn methods and technics.

First of all, I need a secure way to keep database passwords secure, so 
I have to keep them separate from the main server. The right approach 
could be using a small java bean application that run as normal user 
(not tomcat, so it is not shared with other web services or, worst, the 
nobody user), that has no shell login, but has a default home directory 
or a place where it can hold passwords and keys.

The web application could then open an ssl connection (could be done in 
the init method at server startup) to get database passwords. The small 
bean could check via code signature/rmi/whatever else that the source 
is the right one, and handle all the database connections, or give the 
db connection/password to the main web application.

In this way, we solve the problem of keeping the keys and passwords in 
shared directories, and also, an attacker should get root/bean user 
account to read data. This is not perfect, and works only if your 
provider gives the opportunity to configure a separated java 
application (that means, really, another server running in the 
background).

Any suggestions?

Thank you,
Mario Torre

Why ""Eek""? :-)
If no /dev/dvd exists, it'll create it.
If /dev/dvd exists, it won't touch it.
If someone installs ogle (a DVD player), I'm assuming the hardware is
recent enough for software playback and that the drive is a DVD-ROM... all
of them support DMA! But since that change requires a reboot or a manual
change, I'm still hesitating to integrate it :-/

My goal is to allow users to install a DVD player through synaptic and play
DVDs in no time. Outputting a message in the %post section of a package is
always a bad idea, putting the tip in the %description sounds good though.

One of the weirdest things I heard when listening to the Cato Institute debate 
was an economist claim ""a tenet of my profession is that people won't pay for 
something they can get for free."" Someone objected, using the analogy of 
bottled water. There's a far better example: The New York Times.  

Incredibly, this institution puts out pages and pages of high-quality 
professional content each week and then distributes them by means of men in 
trucks across the country overnight where they sit, waiting to be sold to 
people. Meanwhile, the exact same content is available _for free_ using an 
insidious peer-to-peer downloading system called ""the Web"" by typing in the 
keyword ""www.nytimes.com"". Those people at the New York Times must not 
understand the Internet or something! 

More examples: the thriving shareware market, the Baen Free Library, Janis Ian 
and others. 

Other times, people claim that no one will create if they can't get paid. I'd 
like to introduce you to free software and just about every weblog on the

Do you really think this is true?  I added a modify time check thinking that 
it would make an improvement since we were reading it a *lot* more times in 
the new code because we're trying to use the sequences.

On the other hand, the sequences files are probably being read out of cache 
when that happens anyway.

Even with a small file, I'd think that the time taken to do a 
[file mtime $filename] would be worth it.  My code is in proc MhReadSeqs.

We in the game industry know what we mean when we say that a game is 
""addictive."" We think that quality in a game is a good thing: people like it, 
they keep coming back to it, and they want to play it more and more. I agree 
that it's a good thing. If a game has that quality, then it's probably a darn 
good game. But using the word ""addiction"" to describe that quality does us no

Curious.  I changed the arguments to Ftoc_ShowSequences to drop the folder 
argument and instead have an optional msgids argument.  Somehow your version 
of ScanFolder is still trying to pass $F.  You seem to have the latest 
ftoc.tcl (1.36), but not the latest scan.tcl (1.27).

I don't know how that happened, but try getting your source tree completely 
up to date.

Heh. I get to see bad CDROM problems all the time. Mostly when vendors
buy crap cables to try to save $0.02/each, but there are chipsets and
drives with known DMA issues as well.

Usually if you enable DMA on a CDROM that can't handle it gracefully you
won't be able to read data off it relably, and that's about it. No
end_of_the_world problems, and easily fixed.

> I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting

My biggest beef with automatically setting /dev/dvd is that I always
seem to have a CD-Burner and a DVD drive (or DVD burner) in the same
box, and I usually have the DVD as the second drive /dev/cdrom1 in
""kudzu-speak"". I agree that the %description is the best place for the
tip. Unless someone can come up with a way to probe CD/DVD drives to
divulge their largest supported media size without loading ide-scsi or
having that media currently in the drive.

This is exactly what I think. SpamAssassin has always been conservative

I say start it with a zero score and put it in 70_cvs_rules_under_test like
any other unproven rule. Then score it based on actual results, not
promises. My corpus does not yet contain a single non-spam (or spam) message
with a Habeas mark. Based on that, it doesn't impress me and it wouldn't
impress the GA either. Rules with exactly the same statistics are being
dropped from SA right now, and I don't see why this should be any different.

Quite some modules from CPAN do have a line like this nowadays (I think or 
read so somewhere, respectively). And the Perl error message is very clear: 
""ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at

I could think of a solution: We could remove the ""use"" line and add the 
version to PREREQ_PM. After WriteMakefile() we could add the lines 
  require ExtUtils::MakeMaker; 
  ExtUtils::MakeMaker->VERSION(5.45); 
to do per hand what 'use ExtUtils::MakeMaker 5.45' does automagically; `perl 
Makefile.PL` will die with a ""Uncaught exception from user code: 
ExtUtils::MakeMaker version 5.45 required--this is only version 5.4302 at 
Makefile.PL line 103."" there but we've got a Makefile. But I don't know if 
CPAN will run the make anyway...

We could call the preprocessor on install time. That's not a very clean 
approach but could work. 
 
We can also overwrite pm_to_blib in the Makefile directly per postamble. We 
already have a useless line ""pm_to_blib: spamassassin doc/.made"" there. Adding 
some commands in this section gives some make warnings (""Makefile:933: 
warning: overriding commands for target `pm_to_blib' Makefile:877: warning: 
ignoring old commands for target `pm_to_blib'"") but does work. Not a very good 
solution either.

The ""use MakeMaker::..."" error message is IMHO quite clear, so I think it's ok 
to require the user to do a manual update of ExtUtils::MakeMaker before the SA 
installation. But that's just my opinion ;-) 
 
I'll ask on makemaker@perl.org for the best solution. They should know.

OTOH, look into DCC (Distributed Checksum Clearinghouse,
http://www.rhyolite.com/anti-spam/dcc/), which uses fuzzy checksums.
It's quite likely that DCC's checksumming scheme is better than
something any of us would throw together for personal use (no offense,
Skip!).  But I have no personal experience of it.

Most spammers don't check reply codes at all, they just send out as many
mails as their system will hold without checking for any confirmation.

A trick to lower spam reception was dicussed on the postfix mailing list
some time ago: answer all incoming mail with a 4xx temporary error code when
it is offered the first time, and accept it the second time. Apparently most
mass-emailers don't even try to deliver a second time.

Uh... the reason is simple. Habeas runs something called the 
""Habeas Infringers List"", and if you use their trademark without 
their permission, you'll end up on it.  Then, when you send spam 
with the misappropriated header, users of SA (2.40 supports 
this) will tag your mail as spam, rather than let it through. 
This may be done independantly of your IP address, so be 
prepared to constantly change domain names, and move your 
servers as fast as you send spam.

Also, that little haiku is a copyrighted work, so not only CAN 
Habeas sue, they MUST sue to protect their copyright. And since 
it's a trademark as well, that's a double-whammy. Habeas has 
some pretty high-powered legal people, who will gladly go to 
town on violators.

The whole point here is to give them the legal leverage they 
need to put spammers out of business, and not only block mail 
from them, but allow through the things that really AREN'T spam.

[SAtalk] user_prefs ignored,"This is just an semi-educated guess - if I'm wrong, someone please correct
me!

Spamd setuid's to the user running spamc. Since you're calling spamc from a
global procmailrc file, it's being run as root (most likely). If called as
root, spamd won't open user_prefs files.

>>From the spamc man page:

       -u username
           This argument has been semi-obsoleted.  To have spamd use
           per-user-config files, run spamc as the user whose config
           files spamd should load.  If you're running spamc as some
           other user though (eg. root, mail, nobody, cyrus, etc.)
           then you can still use this flag.


The solution is to set DROPPRIVS=yes in /etc/procmailrc, just before running
spamc. From the procmailrc man page:

       DROPPRIVS   If set to `yes' procmail will drop all privileges
                   it might have had (suid or sgid).  This  is  only
                   useful  if  you  want  to guarantee that the bottom
                   half of the /etc/procmailrc file is executed on
                   behalf of the recipient.


I hope that helps, and I also hope it's right!

| Hi All,

|
| spamd is run as root with the flags ""-d -a -c"", and spamc isn't run with

|

Yup.  TMDA's core functionality was fully established before even the

Yep.  The primary reason I released this, was to provide a good, big
corpus for academic testing of filter systems; it allows results to
be compared between filters using a known corpus.

For SpamAssassin development, everyone has to maintain their own corpus.

Following that reasoning, I've been installing all my custom-built
kernels through rpm recently. I find it annoying, though, that 
alsa-kernel, and similar packages, will only build for the currently 
running kernel.

So I've attached a patch to specify an alternate kernel by setting the
""TARGET_KERNEL"" environment variable before running rpmbuild. You
still need to have the rpm for the specified kernel installed, but at
least it doesn't have to be currently running. It's kinda hackish, so
if someone has a better way to do this, let me know.

ball players addicted to video football,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85531549
Date: Not supplied

Pro football players are addicted to football games, as a means of 
wish-fulfillment -- by ""managing"" the team, they can be free of the rule of 
their coaches and bosses. Maybe this explains the amazing success of The Sims, 
which, on the face of it, should be dull as hell: While away your free time 
away from the office by simulating an existence as a shlub with a day-job and a 
drive to acquire consumer goods on credit. You'd think it'd be the last thing 
you want to do. But it's not. When you're a Sim, you can tweak your existence a 
smidge, discover what life would be like if you took Path A instead of Path B, 
try the alternate universe on for size. The idea of football players playing 
themselves in licensed video games is neat and recursive, like the episode of 
the Simpsons when Mr. Burns runs into Krusty buying Krusty-O's at the 
supermarket and asks where he can find the ""Burns-O's."" 

    ""It's always a trip,"" Carr says. ""The first time I saw myself in a video 
    game was in college (at Fresno State) when I walked into a Best Buy store 
    and some kid was playing with me. That kind of trips you out a little bit."" 
    

    For every 12-year-old kid who spends countless hours in front of a 
    television playing video games, there's a group of 300-pound offensive 
    linemen challenging each other at everything from Madden NFL 2003 to the 
    action-packed ""Halo: Combat Evolved.""

I think I could handle commenting out the lowest SPAM_PHRASE_XX_YY
scores.  If the GA could handle this sort of thing so they'd
automatically be zeroed, I'd feel better since the ranges could change
next time the phrase list is regenerated or the algorithm tweaked.

I think we need to understand why DATE_IN_PAST_48_96 is so low before
we remove it.  The two rules on either side perform quite well.

I only want a bugzilla ticket for each one if people are okay with

If you could put the stats for each rule in the ticket somehow (should

Looks great! One note: most ""image-only"" spam actually has some text (a few

image spam that slips through SA seems to have a bit of text, one huge image, 
then a bit more.

I have one that uses dist to send stuff from my work mail to my 
home mail.  The binding looks like this:

set {bindings(key,HD_Dist_Silently -form distcomps.to-me)} <Meta-dollar>

The ""HD_Dist_Silently"" is a hacked up version of the proc that 
does dist in exmh and is pasted in below.  It's getting old and 
probably should be ""resynced"" with the current code.  But it 
still works (on a relatively recent CVS copy of exmh)

It's also possible that there's an easier way but I hacked this 
together quickly a year or more ago and when it worked I moved 
on to other tasks.

--Hal

proc HD_Dist_Silently { args } {

    global exmh msg

I think perhaps you missed the fact that SA scores are adjustable.  If
you want SA to tag all messages listed in Razor then you can put this
in your ~/.spamassassin/user_prefs file.

  score RAZOR_CHECK 10

The default score is 3 and the default threshold needed is 5.
Therefore if you wish to have any razor listed messages tagged by SA
then setting a score for any razor listed messages to anything above 5
would be sufficient.

If you are already using SA then the above would be more efficient.
Otherwise you are running all of the mail through razor twice, once
for SA and once again afterward.  If you really want to run Razor
individually then you should set the 'score RAZOR_CHECK 0' so that SA
won't do it and avoid the double network hit.

However, one of the benefits of using SA in combination with Razor has
been the history of false positive reports in the razor database.  The
current score of 3 is hefty, but not enough by itself to tag as spam.
But for any real spam is usually enough to push it over the threshold.
Razor2 addresses the false positive problem but is not yet in as wide
of use as Razor1.

I get a pop-up window to enter my passphrase into, and when I type it

For all my recent packages that support --with and --without options, I've
put them in the %description section. See for instance :
http://psyche.freshrpms.net/rpm.html?id=80

Where you can see :
Available rpmbuild rebuild options :
--with : alsa
--without : aalib lirc libdv arts

The ogle package has also a --with alsa option, and I've had a bug report
about xine that I apparently unintentionally compiled with ALSA directly
:-/

I'd like to aks this on the rpm-zzzlist : Would a new dependency of 250k, the
alsa-lib package, for many packages (mplayer, ogle, xine) be a problem for
the freshrpms.net packages users? As I really feel like blending ALSA in
now, especially since I've just spent some time recompiling alsa-kernel
package for all the Psyche kernels!!!

All it takes is an overtorqued nut (e.g. at the water intake entrance)
to stress the porcelain, and you've got a time bomb waiting to go off.
Of course, if you're lucky, you'll overtorque it enough that the tank

Anolther sequence related traceback,"
I may be wrong but I think a single select entry field is used
for selecting messages and switching folders. Restricting the entries
to be numeric would break the folder switching functionality, wouldn't
it?

My version of MsgChange, not yet updated, has a check

    if {$msgid != {}} {
	# Allow null msgid from Msg_ShowWhat, which supplies line instead
	if {$msgid < 0}  return
    } else {
    ...

at the start of the procedure which takes care of the single '-' case.

Maybe you could find more info or tips on the ALSA page for your card?
Also, you could try ""alsactl store"", editing /etc/asound.state"" by hand
(for me it contains data similar to what I can control with ""alsamixer"")
then run ""alsactl restore"" and see if you're able to change what you want

I think this is a Razor bug/glitch triggered when file permissions
don't allow its own log system to work.  At least that's the report
I heard on the Razor list in the past...

Theo, does it work now that you /dev/null'd the logfile?

I won't bother tagging with Rel, IMO; I don't think we should
rely on the version control system inside our code, so I've just
put a line in Mail/SpamAssassin.pm instead.   I will of course
tag with a release *label* though.

e Sauced...again,"
Over on Arstechnica (www.arstechnica.com) I saw mention of a Wired article
that goes into the many wonderfull ways Apple is showing its love and
respect for its users.

http://www.wired.com/news/mac/0,2125,55395,00.html

There is a good rundown of all the whys and whatfores over at
http://arstechnica.com/reviews/02q3/macosx-10.2/macosx-10.2-5.html

""True to form, industrious third party developers saw that they could gain
a competitive advantage by supporting this more capable user interface in
their applications. Apple's private menu extras APIs were reverse
engineered and leveraged to great effect. The architecture was so popular
that an application for managing predefined sets of menu extras (third
party or otherwise) was in development.

All of that changed with the release of Jaguar--but not because the
private APIs had changed. If they had, third party developers would have
updated their applications to work with the new APIs, as they have
resigned themselves to doing by choosing to use private APIs in the first
place.

But what actually happened in Jaguar was that Apple added code to forcibly
exclude all non-Apple menu extras. Other parts of the API did not change.
But when a menu extra is loaded, it is compared to a hard-coded list of
""known"" menu extras from Apple. If the menu extra is not on that list, it
is not allowed to load.

It's easy to laugh at Steve Ballmer's sweat-soaked gyrations as he chants
""developers, developers, developers!"", but Microsoft clearly understands
something that Apple is still struggling with. It is in a platform
vendor's best interest to encourage development for its platform. In
Apple's case, this doesn't mean that they have to bend over backwards to
make every single system service and UI element ""pluggable"" via public
APIs. That's clearly a lot of work, and not something that needs to be the
number one priority for an OS in its infancy. And in the meantime, if
third party developers want to sell into a market that requires the
desired functionality to be added in ""unsupported"" ways, then they must be
prepared for the maintenance consequences of their decisions.

But for Apple to go out of its way--to actually expend developer
effort--to stop these third party developers, while still failing to
provide a supported alternative, is incredibly foolish. ""

A huge improvement, but for wrong reasons ... except not entirely!  The most
powerful discriminator in the whole database on one training set became:

That's got nothing to do with BruceG, right?

        'received:bfsmedia.com'

was also a strong spam indicator across all training sets.  I'm jealous.

Neil, are using your own tokenizer now, or the tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize
generator?  Whichever, someone who's not afraid of their headers should try
adding mboxtest.MyTokenizer.tokenize_headers into the mix, once in lieu of
tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers(), and again in addition to it.  Jeremy
reported on just the former.

oblem with apt-get,"Hi,

In my build scripts, I have problems with some of the kernel packages.

For kernel-sources, I get :

Package kernel-source is a virtual package provided by:
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3
  kernel-source#2.4.18-3 2.4.18-3

on running apt-get install kernel-source

Now, first of all, this doesn't really tell me what the two options are ;)
Second, is there some way I can tell apt-get to install either ? This is 
done from automatic build scripts so I'd like it to proceed anyway.

Thanks,
Thomas

zteana] A New Theory on Mapping the New World,"http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A46455-2002Oct5.html

A New Theory on Mapping the New World

By Guy Gugliotta
Washington Post Staff Writer
Monday, October 7, 2002; Page A07

In 1507, a group of scholars working in France produced an extraordinary map
of the world, the first to put the still-recent discoveries of Columbus and
others into a new continent separate from Asia, and to call that continent
""America."" With the Waldseemuller map, the New World was born.
But there was something else. What would later come to be called South
America and Central America were surprisingly well-shaped, not only on the
east coast, where explorers had already sailed, but also on the west coast
-- which no European was known to have seen.
The ice cream cone bulge that sticks out into the Pacific at the junction of
modern-day Chile and Peru is readily visible and in almost exactly the right
geographical spot -- not only in the main map, but also in an inset printed
along its top.
The shape of South America in the main map appears distorted because of the
curvature of the Earth.
It is an improbable coincidence, if it was a coincidence, for the map -- 12
large printed pages to be arrayed in one 36-square-foot wall display -- was
published six years before Vasco Balboa's 1513 trip across the Isthmus of
Panama and 12 years before Ferdinand Magellan's 1519-22 trip around the
world.
Did someone get there earlier?

I just had to jump in here as Carbonara is one of my favourites to make and ask 
what the hell are you supposed to use instead of cream?  I've never seen a 
recipe that hasn't used this.  Personally I use low fat creme fraiche because it 
works quite nicely but the only time I've seen an supposedly authentic recipe 
for carbonara  it was identical to mine (cream, eggs and lots of fresh parmesan) 
except for the creme fraiche.

You've redefined ""promiscuity"" above as ""total"" or ""average"" 
activity, which seems to rob it of its common meaning: 
activity above some specific threshold (usually ""one"") or 
norm, or involving extra or indiscriminate variety. 
""Promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of 
distributions rather than averages.

Consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. Let
there be three pairings which result in each person
having sex once. Then, let one of the males also have 
sex with the other two females. 

Sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners
is equal between the sexes, tautologically. 

But here more women than men are:
 - above the single partner threshold
 - above the overall average 1.67 acts/partners threshold
 - above the overall median 1.5 acts/partners
 - above the overall mode 1 acts/partners

And here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) 
number of partners.

So in this contrived population, females are more 
""promiscuous"" than males, unless ""promiscuity"" is 
defined uselessly.

That sounds like fun. But it sets the wrong precedent.
Here's the better idea. Invite her for an afternoon
cruise under the Golden Gate bridge in your Stonehorse
day sailor. Under way, ask her if she'd like to take
the stick. Back at slip, cook her dinner. Something
simple, but good, maybe a stir fry or a stew, served
in the cockpit, with an inexpensive but potable wine.

If she runs away after that, 'tis good riddance. If
she wants to try it again, another day, she shows
promise. If she asks you to show her the V berth, you
have a girlfriend. If she notes your brightwork needs

Opening arguments are set to begin early next month in Eldred vs. Ashcroft,
a landmark U.S. Supreme Court case that will decide the future of copyright
law, including how and when artists and writers can build upon the work of
others.

....

To heighten public awareness of the importance of the case an Internet
bookmobile is set to depart San Francisco next Monday on a trip that will
bring it to the steps of the Supreme Court building in Washington, D.C.,
before arguments wrap up. The van, which will be stopping at schools,
libraries and senior centers along the way, is equipped to provide free
high-speed access to thousands of literary and artistic works that are
already in the public domain.

--------

I had the opportunity to visit the Internet Archive about a month ago, and
saw the bookmobile under construction. It's a neat idea. Take an SUV, put a
small satellite dish on the top, and put a computer, printer, and binding
machine in the back. Voila -- people can search for a book, then print out a
copy right there on the spot. Quite literally on-demand printing. Total
fixed cost of the computer/printer/binding machine, if bought new (the IA
had the equipment donated) is under $10k.

One of the goals is to show libraries across the country that they could, if
they wished, add these ""virtual holdings"" (public domain materials) to their
existing library, at a fixed cost most libraries can afford. This should be
compelling to small libraries in remote areas.

Since the pick command works, the sequence (actually, both of them, the

one that comes from .mh_profile) do get created.

This is a standard trap for people building things from source. It's
generally wise to have a special ""build"" environment to avoid these
hassles. Most likely you have some library loading path in your env. An
strace of the app will show it:

	the-app 2>&1 | grep dude

Personally, I have a script called logbuild whose entire purpose is to
start a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The
prevents this kind of error. Since configure yanks all sorts of ill
documented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,
various LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.

Often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile
for building stuff.

zteana] Punch bags filled with incontinence pads,"

http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633932.Bizarre+London.0.html

An investigation has been launched after punch bags on sale in Greenwich 
were found to be stuffed with incontinence pads and bandages.

Trading standards officers, working for Greenwich Council, were alerted to 
the situation after a Bryan punch bag, purchased in Argos, in Charlton Road, 
Charlton, was found to be full of bandages.

Also stuffed inside the piece of sporting equipment was a letter from a 
woman in Fife stating how she felt quite disgusted' about the bag and asking 
for the filling to be tested.

The unfortunate shopper had bought his first bag, at Argos, in Lewisham High 
Street, but had returned it because on investigation of a leak he was 
horrified to discover it was filled with incontinence pads.

So far, officers have purchased two of the punch bags, only to find they 
contain incontinence pads and strips of shredded duvet.

Cabinet member for public services Councillor Angela Cornforth said: ""This 
is one of the strangest stories I have every heard.

""Our officers are in the process of investigating and will no doubt discover 
why the bags contain such unusual contents.""

[ILUG] eircoms adsl modems,"
Not true on the choice part.

After three weeks of me telling eircom that I did not in fact need nor want
their ?1800 worth of router and firewall
nor their onsite survey... for the uncapped service I actually managed to
get a 4 port modem (after asking for a 1 port modem) instead of ye olde
hardware router & firewall and eircom onsite.

I would have argued for the 1 port modem... (which I had asked for), but a
Director wanted the DSL up ... and fast....

Still it only took me three weeks to get (almost) what I

This wouldn't be worth the effort involved IMHO, and would probably end up
in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested.
Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packages

Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.

Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-)

Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

WTF do my shitty math skillz have to do with girls and

just felt like calling you on it.

BTW, there's nothing wrong with calling someone on a silly idea.  Its

There is a bit of circumstantial evidence - apparently some MT

dejanews/google groups showed a number of messages from him, clearly

Ouch...,"LOL!  They're not doomed at all.  Thousands of men wear cb2000s to work 
every day (along with other chastity devices).    They are not just 
decorations.  You will not get a woody or have an orgasm until your 
keyholder allows you to.  Anyhow, I know better than to have this 
type of conversation with a 'nilla, but these men wear these happily, and 
consensually.  (:  There is little power struggle in the lifestyles of the 
people who use these.  There is power exchange instead.  Lots of 
variations on the definition, but this one's from Gloria Brame's site:

Power exchange: the consensual transfer of power by the submissive to the 
dominant. The exchange takes place when the returned energy from the 
dominant empowers the submissive. 

Anyhow, there are tons of informative sites out there for anyone who cares 
to read them, but I assure you, the chastity device business is doing very 
well, and it is illegal to force someone to wear one.  It's not coercion, 
it is creative sensuality.  (:

ing junk computers into activist gold,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85481566
Date: Not supplied

Great article on a group of East Bay activists who rehab junk computers, using 
semi-skilled volunteers who train other semi-skilled volunteers. The resulting 
computers are sent to the developing world for activist use. 

    For the Amazonian villages where there's no electricity or where phone 
    lines are scarce, the activists plan to set up free computer labs in the 
    nearby cities. Many cities already have commercial Internet cafes, but they 
    cost about a dollar per hour of use, Henshaw-Plath says, which is about a 
    day's wage for most of the population. 

    The IMC activists plan to ship off these computers to Guayaquil, Ecuador's 
    main port city, by the end of September. Because none of the computers are 
    being sold in Ecuador, and because they're being transferred from an 
    American nonprofit to an Ecuadorian one, the activists won't be charged any 
    international shipping duties on the computers. ""It's what you call real 
    free trade,"" says Eddie Nix.

The advantage of using a kitchen sink (umm, make that highly programmable)
editor+email package like Emacs+VM is that you can twiddle your key bindings
and write a little ELisp (or Pymacs) glue to toss messages in the right
direction (spam or ham).  For this, spambayes would have to operate in an
incremental fashion when fed a single ham or spam message.

I think my mail wasn't very clear ;-) My point was that we should continue 
releasing new rules and removing broken ones (all based on discussions on 
this list of course) in the 2.4 branch instead of creating a new 2.5 branch 
everytime we have a bunch of new rules.

A new branch should be openend only if (big) new features are introduced 
(eg. Bayes) or the interface has changed (spam_level_char=x). As the rules 
are under fluent development, the user has to update quite regularly. But 
currently he couldn't be shure if the new release will break anything in 
his setup (like -F going away). So if we say ""the branches are stable to 
the outside and just improved under the surface but you have to watch out 
when you update to a new minor version number"", users and sysadmins could 
be less reluctant to update.

All just IMHO :o)

A flippant remark that I will probably regret  - sure there's assholes 
everywhere. I just remember a lunch in Spain with
a semi-famous American - I think we had about 10 nationalities at the 
table, and he managed to insult each of them within
15 minutes. A historical perspective makes me think that empires - 
Roman, British, Russian, American, whatever - produce
 a larger proportion of assholes than subject nations (and are more 
likely to have them in positions of authority).

    they be, and how'd they get on? 

    *Mark:* The zine would be Jethro Bodine of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" -- 
    curious, neophilic, xenophilic, gleeful, and eager to adopt any new theory

e we were on the subject...,"
Gays, gay sex, gay marriage.....wooohooo its been a mano e mano week and
thursady will be the mass market consumer period on it.

The WWE's gay marriage cermemony is in the can, that is its been filmed
last night for thursady nights Smackdown. Did they do it tastefully? Oh
come on its the WWE for cripssake, of course they didnt. Did they use it
ot promote an story line? Despite the WWE throwing away more good story
lines in the last 2 years than a wood chuck who could chuck wood if the
enviromentalists did not slap lawsuits on them, the sotrywrites seemed to
have finaly hit on a big tie togther event for several story lines.

But of course, no one here watches the WWE, and not even because you would
rather watch old Divxs of the ECW, so this little bit is probably fallign
on the old killsawfiles.

SO I wont be bursting anyones thursdaynight plans if I smarkout and say
that B and C waver near the final vows, the blame is falling on Ricco,
thier ""manager""*, for  pushing them to carry out their ""gay"" act far too
long and just when things look to be heating up with that story
arc......the mask comes off the justice of the piece as he pronounces
that they have gone 3  minutes, yes 3 minutes, too long.....Yep, its the
Bisch and in come Rosey  and Jamal to attempt a stomping on Stpehnie
McMahon. Hopefully they did  not get off a kick like they did on the first
lesbain back on Mondays raw as that broke a rib.

Of course the editing truck boys might change some none or all of this
around, so if thursday nights tape play reveals them hitch and on thier
way to a honeymoon, thats the luck o the smarkies. I doubt it will be
edited much though from the way I heard it.

So the bottomline is, they really were not gay all along, they were play
acting and it got out of hand because Ricco made them, Steaphnie gets a
face push while the Bisch gets a thursady night special 3 min heel push,
thus furthing the story arc of the brand split. Rosey and Jamala  get heat
and B and C get a new Tag Team to play with.  Ricco..who knows, maybe some
heat time would be good for him as a single.

All this of course at a time when the ratting are in the bottom of a 4
year valley of gloom, the last 2 years have been mostly squandered on
borken story arc promises and bad acting, and to top it all off Mick is no
longer ont he sceen so...bang bang...how can it be all good?

Well, its back to my growing ECW divx collection where Tajiri was the shiz
and Mick cut promos unrivaled by any of todays mic monkeys.

* Todays managers are a far cry form the managers of the 80's/early 90's.

Which means the sender has a list of who the true
targets are, and who the fake targets are, and
scripts for mixing these. On the receiving side,
my email client distinguishes between messages
that are read, and messages that are not. I like
to mark or save messages that are particularly
interresting or important to me. And even if I
make a point to delete ""suspicious material""

leave an interesting kind of trace on my machine.

Sorry, but I don't buy the argument that spam

I would like to use [Link] a lot more, but is it rather
inconvenient.

I have set my right mouse button to [Move] a message to another
folder, which works fine.

However, [Link] also uses the same destination folder as [Move], and
so if I want to use [Link] I first have to mark the destination
folder with a message-move, undo the move, then I can use the
[Link].  Very inconvenient.

Is there a better way for me to set this up so that [Link] works
with one or two simple clicks?

(In essence: is there a way to mark a destination folder for a
message link or move without actually doing a move or link, I
couldn't see anything obvious).

Cheers
Tony

No reboot is required, you just need to remount it:

	# mount -o remount,rw /usr

This requires root access, but presumably /usr is safe from non-root
users anyway.

Only way to disable this is to have the kernel compiled with something
that compartmentalizes capabilities (LIDS/etc on Linux for example) or to
remove CAP_SYS_ADMIN with lcap, which would definately require a reboot,
and possibly break some other functionatily to boot.  (Pun intended.  My
apologies.)

The Curse of India's Socialism,"I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.

Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).

Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.

So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]


The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.


The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]



BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...


In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

RAH

With a freshly installed SpamAssassin 2.41 and Razor 2.14 I'm seeing these

Jim explains it. (It was a rocket test from the Vandenburg air force base). 
Very neat. It was a bit too blurred out when I saw it, and there was too much

Yea, and that on top of the 100x of all the parsing engines over just
bigendian'ing it and passing the data (5x+++) in the raw. Then it REALLY

As I understand it, there is a huge difference between native Americans
who speak english at home and those who do not.  I don't have figures
that separate those at hand, though.

1989 American Indians (US Pop as a whole) -- Families below poverty
27.2% (10%), Persons below poverty 31.2 (13.1), Speak a language other
than English 23 (13.8) Married couple families 65.8 (79.5) Median family
income $21,619 ($35,225) Per Capita $8,284 ($14,420).

Note: High Income countries in 1989 were defined as having over $6,000
per capita.  American Indians separated from the rest of the US society
would still be considered a high-income society.

>
> The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the

>
> Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine.

> government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the
> poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences
> allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free
> trade.
>
> * Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the

> will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and
> Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of
> developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.
> Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will
> be our principal focal points.
>
> * Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every
> administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with
> Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished
> majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing
> Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for
> developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will
> work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade
> agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade

> integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in

>
> * Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster
> economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with
> widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental

>
> * Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development

> comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other
> multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of
> the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S.

> productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,
> and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant
> must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in

>

> more children are getting a better education, more people have access to

> World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this
> progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything
> that these institutions do.
>
> * Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in
> the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants
> is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,
> particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with
> ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA

> by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development
> banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private
> sector to match government efforts by using grants to support
> development projects that show results.
>
> * Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are
> the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases,
> most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and
> foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows
> as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national
> security strategy.
>
> * Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor
> countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics
> like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be
> threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the
> developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest

> treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than
> twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the
> global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.
>
> * Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of
> democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources
> are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States

zteana] Cambodian Buddhaas unearthed,"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/2220132.stm

Tuesday, 27 August, 2002, 21:35 GMT 22:35 UK
Cambodia temple ruins yield treasure

Workers clearing dense jungle near the ruins of an ancient pagoda in
northern Cambodia have unearthed 31 Buddha statues - 27 of them solid gold.
The statues - which are 10 centimetres (4 inches) tall - are in good
condition and believed to be hundreds of years old.
They were found on Saturday as workers were rebuilding the Po Pich temple
about 100 km (65miles) north of the capital, Phnom Penh.
The pagoda, in the Batay district of Kampong Thom province, was torn down
during the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s and the area became
overgrown.
Community care
Deputy police chief of Kampong Thom province, Hang Sithim, said the statues
- three of which were silver and one bronze - were buried in about one metre
(3.4ft) of earth and each weigh around 500 grams (1lb).
''I think that these Buddha statues had been buried hundreds of years ago,
when the last temple was fully operating,"" Mr Hang Sithim said.
Provincial authorities initially planned to take the statues to a nearby
town for safekeeping, but opted to allow the Buddhist community at the
temple to take care of them.
''We believe they are safe there,'' said Som Somphat, deputy governor of
Kampong Thom province.
''The people of Po Pich pledged to treat them with respect and honour.''
Reign of terror
A police guard has been placed around the site to protect it from looters.
The Khmer Rouge waged civil war in Cambodia between 1970 and 1998 and
controlled the country between 1975 and 1979.
The regime outlawed religion and destroyed many objects regarded as decadent
or culturally impure.
About two million people died in the Khmer Rouge's drive to turn Cambodia
into a farmers' utopia.

Pitch Dark Bar Opens for Blind Dates
Thu Sep 5,10:09 AM ET

BERLIN (Reuters) - Diners at Berlin's newest restaurant cannot see what they
are eating and have to be guided to their table by blind waiters because the
bar is pitch black.

The restaurant, which opened Wednesday, aims to make guests concentrate on
senses other than sight.

Holding on to one another, the first visitors followed waiter Roland
Zimmermann, 33, into the dining room. Although the PhD student has been
blind since childhood, he is the only one able to point out chairs, cutlery
and drinks.

""I'm putting your plate right in front of you,"" Zimmermann said. ""I can't
find my mouth,"" one voice replied out of the dark. ""I wonder what this dish
is -- Lasagne? Or some casserole?"" another invisible guest said.

In the ""unsicht-Bar,"" which means invisible in German, diners cannot choose
complete dishes from the menu but can only indicate whether they would like
a fish, meat or vegetarian option.

""We want people to have an extraordinary experience of tasting, feeling and
smelling,"" said Manfred Scharbach, head of the organization for blind and
sight-restricted people, which is running the bar.

""People are surprised that their tongues and taste senses are taking over
and are sending signals, which their eyes would normally have sent,"" he
added.

Of the 30 staff, 22 are blind.

An average meal lasts about three hours and the waiters are always around to
help, Scharnbach said.

And at the end of the night, they will even reveal what customers have
actually been eating.

not require any texture look-up and is scalable, making it possible to spend

Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger and others Cliff Skolnik at the O'Reilly OS X con 
has tracked down the cause of the annoying flakiness in the wireless network 
here -- every 20 or 30 seconds, you start getting ""connection refused"" messages 
from your browser and other net-utilities. Rob ""Pringles Can"" Flickenger wrote 
it up. 

It turns out that running the great network-spy app Etherpeg[1] (or other 
""promiscuous"" network sniffers) and the built-in firewall in OS X at the same 
time causes your computer to begin intercepting every packet sent out on your 
segment of the wireless network and respond to it with a ""rejected"" message. 

So today, Rob (and everyone else who knows about this) is going to run around 
and tell people running Etherpeg to _turn off the firewall_ (and vice-versa).

I'm facing another problem right now. It looks like libsigc++ is no longer

GAB> I thought this nekkid URL was going to be about the
GAB> infringement of 1st amendment rights for broadcasters
GAB> and proposed campaign finanice restrictions preventing them
GAB> from making money on advertisements that are deemed
GAB> thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary

GAB> thought there'd be some.

GAB> Instead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neill

GAB> he's poking fun at the idea that specific groups

GAB> what zones to most expediently keep order.  

Oh thats right Greg.  Because was explicitly clear that the pro-Bush
folks went out and did the permit dance.   So where in the article is
this again?

Lets get something straight here.   This -is- a First Amendment issue.
Public streets, provided one isn't blocking traffic, generally tend to
be sorta ok, at least from my last interpretation of Con Law a few
years ago (I'll feign ignorance wrt the fact that laws may have
changed, and the specific facts in this case are weak).    IF this guy
_was_ merely holding a sign (which it seems was the case for all the
pro-bush folks) he did nothing wrong.  He certainly didn't do enough
of a wrong to warrant a disorderly conduct charge.

I'll play with your perspective though.   Lets assume a few things.
If I walk into the city office and tell them I want to peacably
assemble against Bush, do you think they'll give me a permit?
Probably not.   So I lie.   Then the cop does what happened in this
scenario.  HE walks up, checks my permit and finds out that I
falsified my statement to get this said document.   He arrests me.
End of story.

GAB> The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied
GAB> nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting
GAB> political rallies that you don't agree with has become
GAB> common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled
GAB> that there are some restrictions on the first amendment.
GAB> They teach you that your very first year of law school.

I'll agree with Owen on this one.  Muddied my ass.  How hard is it to
chose between a Republocrat or a Demipublican?   Not very.  Shouting
down has grown to become the answer because the government, over a
span of years, and with the help of the Courts -has- limited the
rights we have as citizens under the First Amendment.    If you
question the policy about terrorism, or drugs, or Iraq, or Bush in
general, you're aiding terrorism.   If you challenge the beliefs of
the folks attending the various shadowy G8 conferences, you're an
anarchist, and you're herded off to a 'designated protest spot' miles
away from anything.   Part of the point of speech is to be -heard-.
I can scream on my soapbox in the forest somewhere, and while thats
speech, its not effective speech.  People are screaming and shouting
over the political figures because they cannot be  heard in any other
way.




GAB> I think that given the information as laid out by the story,
GAB> Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free
GAB> speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost 
GAB> every American seems to involve the ability to communicate
GAB> an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing
GAB> a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience
GAB> that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical 
GAB> effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. 

Getting back to my original point.  How do you communicate  an idea to
an unknown audience, if you're miles from where the audience is?   How
do you bypass the rules for being -miles- away from the audience
without violating the rules of the regime?  I don't think Mr. Nell was
throwing pies at Bush.  A sign, the last time I checked, didn't cause
physical injury, or even emotional harm.  If I remember Cohen v.
California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971), its not the individual speaking that
has the requirement to desist, but the individual listening who has
the option to leave.


Just my .02, while its still considered legal.

Bob,

This capacitor drive idea isn't completely stupid, but neither is it well
thought out.

Maxwell (www.maxwell.com) makes and sells high energy density capacitors,
called ultracapacitors.  They deliver them in an air-cooled, voltage
regulated module that will charge to 42 V and hold 128 kilojoules -- roughly
the energy in 2 teaspoons of sugar or a bite of a donut -- and weighs 16
kilograms.  If that electrical energy could all be converted to kinetic
energy, there's enough to get the capacitor module up to about 200 mph -- in
a vacuum.

Suppose you take the entire power density of the capacitor module -- 2.8
kw/kg (~4 hp/kg!) --  and punch it through an electric motor.  How much does
the 64 hp electric motor weigh?  If it were as little as 50 kg -- and I bet
it isn't -- that capacitor and motor would have a top speed of 100 mph --
the speed at which their energy is the 128 kJ that was initially stored
electrically in the capacitor.  And it's not at all obvious that the torque
vs. speed characteristic of 42 V DC motors will support this, or how they do
it without wheels, drive train, etc.

But if they can, they can only do it in a vacuum where there is no drag!

On to the Lunarnationals?  Or would you prefer the bite of donut?

yet more absurdity.,"I knew it'd be a day for insanity.

so anyway, news.com decided to write up two wonderful articles on the
DMCA and decided to link to decss.exe, the very verboten code that
ended up getting 2600 (but none of the other news services that
originally linked) spanked.

Slashdot, of course, links to them.

So now, I link to slashdot.

http://slashdot.org/articles/02/10/07/1331217.shtml?tid=123

I find this all incredibly funny really.  Congress _and_ the courts
relaly do need to be considering how laws such as the DMCA are
applied.  For the most part, these rules are coming down to whose
friend you happen to be, how nefarious the defendant party is, and how
asleep the judge is behind the case (asleep/self-interested/bought).
Its giving me a real cynical view on being a lawyer, thats for sure.

Reuters Market News
  Sun Micro Outlines Roadmap for Managing Networks 
  Friday September 20, 5:00 am ET 
  By Peter Henderson 

  SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Computer maker Sun Microsystems Inc. on Thursday
  said it would create in a few years a network environment that will be as
  straightforward to handle as a single machine, a strategy it calls N1.

  It laid out a road map for a new layer of intelligent software and systems that will meld
  unwieldy networks into easy-to-use systems, a goal similar to those of most rivals
  making computers which manage networks. 
  EMC Corp. announced this week software aimed at allowing users to manage storage
  resources as a pool. Hewlett-Packard Co has a Utility Data Center, designed for
  broader management. International Business Machines Corp's project eLiza is working
  to make computers ""self-healing"" when systems break.

  ""Applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the
  whole idea behind N1 is you stop thinking about that. You don't think about what box
  it is running on,"" Sun Vice President Steve MacKay, head of the N1 program, said in an
  interview on the sidelines of a Sun user conference. 

  Many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or
  water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever
  needed. 
  For that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling
  them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. There are
  still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from
  different vendors to interoperate closely. 
  Sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at
  their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. Network administrators today
  often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. 

  ""It'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised MacKay
  The second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as
  online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, Sun said. 
  Finally, in 2004, Sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on
  the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response
  time for priority users, the company said.

eless,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443744
Date: Not supplied

I just finished reading an article about Mozilla[1] for Salon.com[2]. This 
excerpt was rather amusing.

_It is a good question, because in almost every way, Mozilla is a better 
browser than Navigator. For example, Netscape's best new feature, tabbed 
browsing -- which lets you have several Web pages open in the same browser 
window, and allows you to bookmark all the pages under one name -- was in 
Mozilla many months ago, and the Mozilla project that created it (called 
MultiZilla) already has an improved version available. When asked about this, 
Yecies, of Netscape, said, ""That's true, but the engineer who's working on it 
[for Mozilla] is a Netscape employee. It was always done with the intention of 
fostering general browsing usability for Netscape."" 
_
Yes, ok, I suppose that's true if by ""Netscape employee"" you really meant 
""Apple employee."" and by ""always done with the intention of fostering general 
browsing usability for Netscape"" you meant ""was done in a weekend for Mozilla 
because I thought MultiZilla was cool."" 

Here's how the whole tabbed browsing thing happened. One night I finally 
downloaded an extension called MultiZilla (go check it out on mozdev.org[3]. I 
was particularly impressed with a feature contained in MultiZilla called tabbed 
browsing. I started doing research and discovered NetCaptor[4], a tabbed 
browser that embedded WinIE. 

MultiZilla was cool but at the time suffered from two fundamental flaws that 
prevented the code from being incorporated into the Mozilla tree. The first was 
a UI flaw, namely that at the time it had ripped off NetCaptor down to the last 
context menu item. The GUI was similar enough that there would have been 
definite concerns about so obviously copying some of NetCaptor's more obscure 
capabilities (like sticky names and tab locking). The second concern was that 
the tab behavior wasn't encapsulated cleanly into a widget. 

I produced a simplified version of tabbed browsing on my own time (did it in a 
weekend) that removed some of the geekier NetCaptor features and that 
encapsulated the tab behavior so that the changes to other Navigator files 
would be minimal. Once I established that it didn't degrade performance in the 
single tab case, I checked it in as an experiment.

The response was overwhelming, as were the bugs that started being filed. So 
much so that at first I wanted to back tabbed browsing out of the tree. I was 
overruled by Mozilla, which turned out to be a good thing for all I think. :) 
Even with all the excitement and hoopla surrounding the advent of tabbed 
browsing on the engineering side (and in the Mozilla community), Netscape still 
didn't get it. Netscape marketing prioritized all sorts of useless work that 
nobody had even started above tabbed browsing in their marketing document. They 
continued to do so for months, simply not getting it. It was this odd curiosity 
that one of their engineers had checked in, and they didn't know what to make 
of it.

Only after the press raved about it did Netscape really jump on board. I'm sure 
Netscape is doing the same thing now with popup blocking. Can't you just see it 
now? We'll have a Popup Manager, and a Manager to manage the Popup Manager, and 
twenty-seven preferences for fine-grained control of all aspects of popups. 

Can you believe how disfunctional Netscape is? When their engineers say ""you 
should do this"" or ""you should do that"", they get completely ignored (or blown 
off), but when CNet says ""We didn't like this, or we didn't like that."", 
Netscape scurries to meet their demands. That is simply pathetic.

Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).

However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.

I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.

Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.

I hope this helps some.

:rip on Red Hat 8.0?,"Hello,

Has anyone made a working source RPM for dvd::rip for Red Hat 8.0?
Matthias has a spec file on the site for 0.46, and there are a couple of
spec files lying around on the dvd::rip website, including one I patched
a while ago, but it appears that the Makefile automatically generated is
trying to install the Perl libraries into the system's, and also at the
moment dvd::rip needs to be called with PERLIO=stdio as it seems to not
work with PerlIO on RH8's Perl.

Not too sure what the cleanest way to fix this is - anyone working on
this?

Thanks,

RH 8 no DMA for DVD drive,"On Mon, 7 Oct 2002 19:28:51 +0200

When I worked as a PC repair tech for a Computer store chain, I did
run across quite a few DVD drives that would lock up if DMA was
enabled.  It's more of a chipset/drive problem than a Drive by itself.

New Sequences Window,"    Date:        Wed, 28 Aug 2002 09:22:34 -0500

  | so I'll probably poke around at the sequences performance issues,

Well, there's this wonderful piece of code in MhSeqExpand ...

    # Hack to weed out sequence numbers for messages that don't exist
    foreach m $rseq {
        if ![file exists $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m] {
            Exmh_Debug $mhProfile(path)/$folder/$m not found
            set ix [lsearch $seq $m]
            set seq [lreplace $seq $ix $ix]
        } else {
            # Real hack
            break
        }
    }

which is going to run slow if a sequence happens to start with a bunch
of messages that don't exist.   I'm not sure why it is important that the
first message in the sequence returned exists, but not necessarily any
of the others, but I'm sure glad it is, as MhSeqExpand gets called lots,
and I don't know if I could cope if it were checking every file in the
sequences it is looking at, all the time...

It may help to keep a list of the valid message numbers for the current
folder (though that would then need to be verified against changes to the
directory).   Does tcl have a directory read function?   I assume so...

Mh_Sequence also goes and rereads the files (.mh_sequences and the
context file) but I'm not sure how frequently that one is called.

ALB> Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
ALB> Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
ALB> By Andrew Marshall

ALB> BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
ALB> looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.

ALB> ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
ALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
ALB> knew then there was something special.""

ALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
ALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
ALB> who is expecting their first child.

ALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
ALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
ALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
ALB> in search of a wife.

ALB> ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
ALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""

ALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
ALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
ALB> the couple married.

ALB> MR. MARRIAGE

ALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
ALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
ALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
ALB> agency.

ALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.

ALB> ""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
ALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.""

ALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
ALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
ALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
ALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.

ALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
ALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
ALB> language problems.

ALB> ""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
ALB> Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""

ALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
ALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
ALB> client has found a potential wife.

ALB> ""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
ALB> think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
ALB> usually within the next year.

ALB> Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
ALB> Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
ALB> than 10 percent have broken up.

ALB> Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
ALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.

ALB> ""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
ALB> impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
ALB> down, OK, we'll talk.""'

ALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
ALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
ALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
ALB> stress disorder.

ALB> WHY?

ALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
ALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
ALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
ALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.

ALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
ALB> no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
ALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
ALB> need Wan,"" he said.

ALB> ""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
ALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
ALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
ALB> their future husband.""

ALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
ALB> choose to use his agency.

ALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
ALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
ALB> singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
ALB> not ""God's gift to women.""

ALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
ALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.

ALB> ""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
ALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
ALB> Impossible,"" she said.

ALB> ""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
ALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ALB> ladies from other countries.""

ALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
ALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
ALB> not a major obstacle.

ALB> ""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
ALB> a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
ALB> couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
ALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
ALB> very quickly.""

ALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
ALB> to the West.

ALB> ""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
ALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.""

ALB> PITFALLS

ALB> But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
ALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
ALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.

ALB> ""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
ALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
ALB> spoke to me.""

ALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
ALB> there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""

ALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
ALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.

ALB> ""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
ALB> comers.""

ALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
ALB> arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
ALB> looking for a foreign husband.

ALB> ""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
ALB> Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""

I don't think so: it should be getting a stream of PS from stdin,
but it's not. The printing/spooling system is executing gs but

That might clarify that the later part of the system works, but I

Tourism is the world's largest industry. Using this
to preview your travels, or figure out where you are,
would be very valuable.

Online gaming continues to grow. Screw ""Britannia"", 
real-life Britain would be a fun world to wander/
conquer/explore virtually, in role-playing or real-
time-strategy games.

And of course, as James Rogers points out, it's an
ideal display substrate for all sorts of other 
overlaid data. Maps are great, photrealistic 3-D
maps of everywhere which can have many other static 
and dynamic datasets overlaid are spectacular. 

(Combining those last two thoughts: consider the
static world map, in faded colors, with patches
here-and-there covered by live webcams, stitched
over the static info in bright colors... it'd be
like the ""fog of war"" view in games like Warcraft,
over the real world.)

Here is the bug I opened:

  http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=762

RBLs have the same problem, but there is no negative RBL header rule
with a -20 score that can be forged, so the problem is unique to Habeas.

My primary issue is the magnitude of the negative score and that it was
not determined empirically.  I am also concerned that it was added after
the rules freeze, that such a major change was not discussed in advance,
etc.

There's also no evidence that the rule will actually reduce FPs.  People
who are smart enough to use the rule are probably capable of writing
email that doesn't look like spam (I'm not counting spam mailing lists
which you need to be exempted from spam filtering).

  | ""Paste Sets Insert"".  

Unfortunately, the side effect of that solution is that it is no longer
possible to cut/paste within one sedit window, some intermediate client
always must be used (except in the rare case where you want to select
some text, and then paste it at the same place).

That's because the click that you have to (with this option) make to set
the insert point, also kills the selection (it ends up reverting to the
last selection made in some other window, or something like that).

So, the vast majority of people probably want that ""Paste Sets Insert""
enabled - that one you can learn to live with, the other is much more
painful.

Assuming it's my fault (which it probably is since nobody else has really been 
in there), it's most likely related to the number of sequences in a folder.  
I'd guess that something is either being called that shouldn't be or is being 
called more times than it should be.

Not that I'm aware of.  If you look in the code, there are various places 
where the time function is called in order to see how long it took to do 
things.  You'll probably want to borrow that technique.

For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would need to explain why the
dramatic increase in CO2 concentrations are not increasing the global
temperature. They would also need to explain why, worldwide, glaciers are
melting faster than they have previously in the historical record. That is,
people need more than refutations, they need a compelling alternate
explanation (hint: climate variability doesn't cover all the bases).

Quod erat not demonstrandum at all.

There are massive amounts of libraries for C, Fortran and so on.
To pick an obvious example., if you want to do linear algebra, then
Java isn't a serious candidate at all.

Furthermore, plenty of bugs occur in the libraries too, at a lower
rate due to more users having been bitten by them, but they are much
harder for you to fix than in your own code.

Why do so many people outside of Sun's marketing department consider
Java to be ""Write Once, Debug Everywhere"" ?

I've terminated a number of my own mailing lists at yahoogroups many

people to move, but with about zero success.

I've got currently only one own mailing list there, which I'm going to

zteana] And deliver us from weevil,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,12374,806695,00.html

Weevil pest warms to life in south-west London

James Meek, science correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

They're chomping in Chelsea, Fulham and Pimlico, but despite their fancy
taste in London addresses they are neither posh nor particularly fussy: they
are vine weevils and they want to eat your plants.
Two species of vine weevil previously unable to survive Britain's cold
winters have been discovered in south-west London, and one has also been
detected in Surrey, Cardiff and Edinburgh.
""This is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said
Max Barclay, the curator of beetles at the Natural History Museum in London
who discovered the creatures in the UK.
The black vine weevil has long been native to Britain, causing enormous
damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. But the two new species,
otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known
north of Switzerland, are now prevalent in south London. ""It's very likely
these weevils have been introduced to Britain through imported ornamental
plants from Italy,"" said Dr Barclay. ""It looks like they're here to stay.""
He found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a Chelsea department store
in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a
migrant. It has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in
south-west London. The second invader is not so numerous, but has
established itself firmly in the same area.
Apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and
grape vines. An early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. The
soil-dwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface.
One possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of
Britain is global warming. Earlier springs and milder winters are already a
fact.

Ditto.

Do you know why?  The strangest implied claim there is that it hates MIME
independent of HTML.  For example, the spamprob of 'content-type:text/plain'
in that pickle is under 0.21.  'content-type:multipart/alternative' gets
0.93, but that's not a killer clue, and one bit of good content will more
than cancel it out.

WRT hating HTML, possibilities include:

1. It really had to do with something other than MIME/HTML.

2. These are pure HTML (not multipart/alternative with a text/plain part),
   so that the tags aren't getting stripped.  The pickled classifier
   despises all hints of HTML due to its c.l.py heritage.

3. These are multipart/alternative with a text/plain part, but the
   latter doesn't contain the same text as the text/html part (for
   example, as Anthony reported, perhaps the text/plain part just
   says something like ""This is an HMTL message."").

If it's #2, it would be easy to add an optional bool argument to tokenize()
meaning ""even if it is pure HTML, strip the tags anyway"".  In fact, I'd like
to do that and default it to True.  The extreme hatred of HTML on tech lists
strikes me as, umm, extreme <wink>.

> So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).

That would be a different experiment.  I'm certainly curious to see whether
Jeremy's much-worse-than-mine error rates are typical or aberrant.

If we ever <wink> have a shared corpus, an easy refactoring of timtest
should allow to plug in different tokenizers.  I've only made three changes
to Graham's algorithm so far (well, I've made dozens -- only three survived
testing as proven winners), all the rest has been refining the tokenization
to provide better clues.

That's ambiguous.  Accuracy rates or error rates, ham or spam rates?

Mining embedded http/https/ftp thingies cut the false negative rate in half
in my tests (not keying off href, just scanning for anything that ""looked
like"" one); that was the single biggest f-n improvement I've seen.  It
didn't change the false positive rate.  So you know whether src added
additional power, or did you do both at once?

Actually, I take that back.  You're not running the latest ftoc.tcl either.

Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, ""The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""

Status:   False.

Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""

The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""

This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.

Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

Sender: nettime-l-request@bbs.thing.net
Reply-To: Phil Duncan <PDuncan@AggregateStudio.com>

The following prayer is from a story by Mark Twain, and was quoted by Lewis
Laphan in the October issue of Harper's magazine. It occurs at the very end
of an excellent article which I recommend to you.

In the story, an old man enters a church where the congregation has been
listening to an heroic sermon about ""the glory to be won in battle by young
patriots armed with the love of God."" He usurps the pulpit and prays the
following:

""O Lord our God, help us to tear their soldiers to bloody shreads with our
shells; help us to cover their smiling fields with the pale forms of their
patriot dead; help us to drown the thunder of the guns with the shrieks of
their wounded, writhing in pain; help us to lay waste their humble homes with
a hurricane of fire; help us to wring the hearts of their unoffending widows
with unavailing grief; help us to turn them out roofless with their little
children to wander unfriended the wastes of their desolated land in rags and
hunger and thirst, sports of the sun flames in summer and the icy winds of
winter, broken in spirit, worn with travail, imploring Thee for the refuge of
the grave and denied it -- for our sakes who adore Thee, Lord, blast their
hopes, blight their lives, protract their bitter pilgrimage, make heavy their
steps, water their way with their tears, stain the white snow with the blood
of their wounded feet! We ask it, in the spirit of love, of Him Who is the
Source of Love, and Who is the ever-faithful refuge and friend of all that
are sore beset and seek His aid with humble and contrite hearts. Amen.""

Twain wrote the story, ""The War Prayer,"" in 1905 during the American
occupation of the Philippines, but the story wasn't printed until 1923,
thirteen years after his death, because the editors thought it ""unsuitable""
for publication at the time it was written.

ong>Two New AmphetaDesk Hacks</strong>,"URL: 4538e94b3b2c6b19041756b37b1f9916
Date: Not supplied

Since the AmphetaDesk source code is so easily modifiable on any platform, I've 
been seeing some interesting hacks and modifications lately. The most powerful 
of them is l.m. orchard's newest template[1], which provides an insane amount 
of new features, including hiding old items, click counting, and an outline 
based format. More than likely, a revised version of his hack will appear as a 
selectable template in the next version (AmphetaDesk v0.94). 

Also of interest is Brian Cantoni's FTPStore[2]: _""FTPstore is a slight 
addition to the AmphetaDesk news aggregator. The modified code will retrieve 
the personal channel list from an FTP location during startup and store it back 
to the same location during shutdown. This provides a simple method to keep 
your saved channels in a network location. If you use AmphetaDesk at home and 
at work, for example, this feature will let you keep your list of channels in 
sync.""_ It's a major improvement for AmphetaDesk users with multiple machines.

If you can spare the memory, you might get better performance in this

 (almost) made easy,"Hi all,

I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
that, right? ;-)

I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
maybe others, who knows ;-)

Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
- Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel
  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
- Install this ""alsa-driver"" package
- Install the ""alsa-libs"" package
- Install the ""alsa-utils"" package

Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
(very complete and very good documentation!)
Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)

Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and
insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to
check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.

With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
files... that's it!

It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release, so does the architecture!).

I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!

Download :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/

Current spec files :
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec
(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )

Matthias

PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

And where does this end? Shouting down speakers is an obviously stupid
tactic if they are -really- interested in advocating change. Are they such
clueless social morons that they don't see this or are they just interested

Header forgeries are trivially easy to detect. The main way that 
spammers hide their originating IPs is not by forging headers, 
but by sending through open proxy servers.  It used to be that 
spammers used open relay mailserver, but these often betray the 
originating IP, and the proliferation of open relay blocklists, 
and the introduction of port 25 blocking on the part of many 
ISPs make open relays unattractive to spammers.

One would think, that the combination of a forged Habeas-SWE, 
and mail sent through an anonymizing open proxy would be a 
fairly good indication of spam.  Tracking a spammer to his 
meatspace location is not as difficult as you might think, once 
you have legal recourse to subpoena records.

That's pretty good.  I wonder how much better you could do by using some
custom pickler.  I just checked my little dbm file and found a lot of
what I would call bloat:

  >>> import anydbm, hammie
  >>> d = hammie.PersistentGrahamBayes(""ham.db"")
  >>> db = anydbm.open(""ham.db"")
  >>> db[""neale""], len(db[""neale""])
  ('ccopy_reg\n_reconstructor\nq\x01(cclassifier\nWordInfo\nq\x02c__builtin__\nobject\nq\x03NtRq\x04(GA\xce\xbc{\xfd\x94\xbboK\x00K\x00K\x00G?\xe0\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00tb.', 106)
  >>> d.wordinfo[""neale""], len(`d.wordinfo[""neale""]`)
  (WordInfo'(1031337979.16197, 0, 0, 0, 0.5)', 42)

Ignoring the fact that there are too many zeros in there, the pickled
version of that WordInfo object is over twice as large as the string
representation.  So we could get a 50% decrease in size just by using
the string representation instead of the pickle, right?

Something about that logic seems wrong to me, but I can't see what it
is.  Maybe pickling is good for heterogeneous data types, but every
value of our big dictionary is going to have the same type, so there's a
ton of redundancy.  I guess that explains why it compressed so well.

Both are reliable.  ""Reliability"" is more a function of the software
engineer.  I've written complicated mission-critical server software in
Java that will run without a hiccup as long as the Unix box it is
sitting on is running.  Same with C.  For processes that are running
months at a time, and in my case constantly touching databases and doing
lots of low-level network stuff, reliability is obtained by making sure
every conceivable problem (and problems you didn't conceive of) recovers
to a clean/safe process state so that things keep running i.e. it is a
design/programming issue.

That said, we usually prototype serious systems in Java and then
re-implement them in C if we have time.  Java doesn't scale well as a
language for server apps, though not for the reasons usually offered. 
The problem is that for high-end server apps, you really need fairly
detailed and low-level control of system resources to get around
bottlenecks that show up relatively quickly in languages that don't give
you access to it.  You can squeeze several times the performance out of
a C server program than a Java one simply by being able to finely tune
(or more frequently, bypass) the system resource management. 
Nonetheless, this is not a significant factor for most applications you
could conceivably develop in either language, as most aren't limited by
raw performance scalability.

Forwarding me stuff from a list is hardly handing me a job. I tracked them

The real problem is you cant even train for jobs now, since they _demand_

Good points all but they don't apply in this case.  Someone is speaking and
a group of selfish bastards only interested in getting their rocks off are
trying to shout him down (they are doing it because 'it's good for the

There is a lot of C++ in the embedded world. With
static object allocation and a few other programming
techniques, performance differences disappear, but
C++ gives a boost in development and maintainability.
The real issue is compiler availability. Almost every
embedded platform has C cross-compilers. Many have
C++ compilers. But there is still a range of

Ah, but you've just gotten to the crux of the
situation.  There's good design and bad design. 
There's good testing and bad testing.  The problem
is, anyone can design a good Web form, but nobody
does.  I think ""best practices"" hasn't caught up
on main street Web enablement yet.  There's some
really great packages on how to do this stuff and
in fact the usability people knew that Web forms needed
to be fixed 5 years ago, so that's why we got XForms
and  XHTML.  You can shoot yourself in the foot and
people usually do.  What the problem is, they don't
even recognize that they're gimpy--ever.  They just
keeping trundling along making a mess of everything
assured in their job security that they can build
Web forms without even caring if they can be
used or not beyond their test machine.

If you had a piece of software and a security warning
came out 5 years ago on it, would you run that software?
Wouldn't you have patched or upgraded something so fundamentally
broken 4 years and 11 months ago?  What I want to know
is why would someone use Web forms best practices from
5 years ago?  I mean you can get a college degree in that
time.  Imagine if the next version of Microsoft Windows
or Red Hat Linux forced you to use a tiled window
manager?  Sure, tiled windows were the best we had for
a brief period of time, but they are completely useless
except for some terminal based replacement applications. 

The bottom line is, if you can't get across the
bridge, then it's broken regardless of whose fault
it really is, and it's the business that 
needs to take responsibility as they are the ones that
wanted to put the bridge there in the first place.

How do you feed procmail? Not with a .forward, I'd guess.

How does mail enter your system anyway? Per fetchmail maybe? Or direct

-driver rebuild fails with undeclared USB symbol,"I am trying to rebuild the recently posted ALSA driver package for my

Sadly, the RPM rebuild fails part way through:

     __ksymtab_snd_hack_usb_set_interface.value')

sprint delivers the next big thing??,"i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?

anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.

Not sure about MG, though I know pretty much everything he penned got into

-fried Twinkies take America by goo,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85481504
Date: Not supplied

Carny concessionaires have taken to selling deep-friend Twinkies, doing big 
business with artery-clogging horripilations: 

    In what may be the biggest setback for the war on fat since supersize 
    fries, Americans are scarfing down thousands of the gooey, calorie-laden 
    snack cakes at county fairs and restaurants across the country. 

    ""We sold 26,000 Twinkies in 18 days. People drove for hours just to taste 
    our Twinkie,"" said Rocky Mullen, who sells the deep-fried, cream-filled 
    treats for $3 (U.S.) each at the Payallup Fair, 50 kilometres south of 
    Seattle. 

    As if Twinkies are not sweet enough already, vendors such as Mr. Mullen add 
    chocolate or berry sauce and sprinkle powdered sugar on top... 

    Hearing about Mr. Sell's invention, Hostess, the company that makes the 
    71-year-old snack, started promoting deep-fried Twinkies to state and 
    county fairs, where a captive population of junk-food addicts began 
    gobbling them up between pig races and tractor-pull competitions. 

    How bad are they for your health? After deep-frying, a Twinkie packs an 
    estimated 400 calories and 28 grams of fat.

OK, gotcha.

I don't think you can do that with exmh, but you can do it on the
command line, if you use sh or ksh:

	for f in `folders -fast -r`
	do
		echo sorting $f ...
		sortm +$f
	done

It could take a long time.

At work, I have to use Outlook.  Ick.  I hate it.  But it does a few
things right.  Like making indices for each folder, and not just by
date, but also by sender, message size, subject.  So I can sort by any
column instantly.

I believe this is possible, too, with an IMAP compliant reader,
provided the IMAP server makes such indices.

I am facing the fact that exmh has been left behind in some industry
standards.  I use it for my personal mail.  My mail server runs unix,
and I connect over ssh and tunnel my X traffic over ssh.  With a slow
link, this makes exmh very slow.  And mime handling is pretty bad
compared with modern mailers.  I am just scared to move.  I've been
using MH or nmh since 1985 and exmh since 1995.  17 years is a long
time!

"el Berlinger has noticed that Mac software shops are starting
    to move t","URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020910.html
Date: Not supplied

Daniel Berlinger has noticed[1] that Mac software shops are starting to move to 
OS X-only development. This makes sense, for two reasons. First, most people 
who pay for software have new computers. So while OS X may only have a small 
fraction of the installed base, it has the majority of the population of people 
who are opening their wallets. Second, if OS X isn't successful, the Mac is _
over_. It's not like System 9 is getting any more popular. 

Then again, there are very few conditions under which it is actually the right 
business decision to develop software for the Macintosh. Developing for the Mac 
is not a whole lot different than creating a web site _that only works on 
Netscape_. (Given the market share of Macs[2] (about 3.5%) and the market share 
of Netscape[3] (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) 

Robb Beal wrote[4]: ""Try this test. Go to a venture firm, angel, or big company 
with a Mac OS X product/concept/prototype. Do they consider the fact that it's 
a Mac application a net plus? (No.)"" Well _duh_. Your product would have to 
appeal to _25 times more Mac _users_ _[as a percentage] than Windows users just 
to break even. In other words, if your Windows product appeals to 1 in 100 
Windows users, you have to appeal to 25 in 100 Mac users to make the same 
amount of money. 

Now, you may want to make an _emotional_ appeal to developing for the Mac. 
That's fine. If you like Macs and you're doing it for fun, more power to ya. 

But as long as we're talking _investment_, you have to tell me why you're going 
to get 25 times as many users. Maybe there's less competition in your category 
on the Mac; maybe you're in a niche like graphics where it seems like Macs 
dominate (they don't, it just seems that way because the elite graphics people 
in big American cities use Macs); maybe your product can't sell to mixed 
environments unless it runs everywhere. But if you want to make an investment 
in Mac software be prepared to demonstrate how you're going to overcome that 
magic 25 multiplier.

This is a good thing.  Getting hammered for stupid investments is likely
to result in smarter investments in the future.  Nobody is supposed to
win all the time, particularly not people who don't do due diligence. 
""A fool and his money are soon parted"" and all that.  It isn't the job

have grave doubts that they could even if it was their job).

So what?  Nobody is guaranteed employment.  Laying people off is not a
crime nor is it immoral.  Companies don't exist to provide employment,
nor should they.  The closest we have to such a thing in the US is a
Government Job, and look at the quality THAT breeds.

Well, (a) you don't HAVE to upgrade, and (b) what you are doing has never
been safe in the first place because SpamAssassin 2.31-and-before doesn't
do any kind of file locking while it writes to the mailbox and doesn't
promise to return the proper failure code on disk-full conditions, etc.

If you're still willing to live with (b), all you need is a little shell
script to run spamassassin:

----------
#!/bin/sh
# call this file ""spamassassin-wrapper"" and chmod +x it
{
echo ""From $1 `date`""
sed -e '1{/^From /d;}' | spamassassin
echo ''
} >> $MAIL
----------

And then use

fetchmail --mda 'spamassassin-wrapper %F'

and you should be all set.

Mmkay.  For the nth time Adam, we don't live in the land of
Adam-fantasy.  Women actually are allowed to do things productive,
independent and entirely free of their male counterparts.  They aren't
forced to cook and clean and merely be sexual vessels.   Sometimes,
and this will come as a shock to you, no doubt, men and women even
find -love- (which is the crucial distinction between this system) and
they marry one another for the satisfaction of being together.   I
know, far-fetched and idealistically crazy as it is, but such things
do happen.   I can guarantee you, if my mother was approached by my
father, and 25 years ago, he commented on her cleaning ability as a
motivator for marrying her, we would not be having this conversation
now.

If guys still have silly antequated ideas about 'women's role' then
their opportunities for finding women _will_ be scarce.   Again, these
situations are great, provided everyone is aware that the relationship
is a contractual one -- he wants a maid, a dog and a prostitute he
doesn't have to pay, and she wants a country that isn't impoverished
and teeming with AIDS.  A contract, versus a true love-interest
marriage.

[can't think of how I'd be running
afoul of the spam filters with this
post, so here's the second try...]

Kissinger's book _Does America Need
a Foreign Policy?_ provides a few
handy abstractions:

> The ultimate dilemma of the statesman is to strike a balance between
> values [""idealism""] and interests [""realism""] and, occasionally,
> between peace and justice.

Also, he views historical American
approaches to foreign policy as a
bundle of three fibers:

Hamiltonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to preserve balances of power.

Wilsonian - We should only get
  involved in foreign adventures
  to further democracy, etc.

Jacksonian - We should never get
  involved in foreign adventures.
  Unless we're attacked.  Then we
  go Rambo.

He has tactfully left out the hard
realists*; as for the rest I gather
wilsonians play the idealists, and
hamiltonians act where values and
interests intersect, and jacksonians 
act only when values and interests
overlap.

Kissinger himself seems to be a
Hamiltonian; much of the book is
about how he thinks we ought to
be shaping the balance of power
in various foreign regions.

Maybe I've been too affected by
Kant, but I can't see that such
a strategy works unless one can
count on a Bismarck runnning it:
how lopsided does the US look if
everyone tries to run a balance
of power politics?

Kings and tyrants generically have
followed the same power politics:
garner popular support by keeping
potential oligarchs down.  In other
traditions, a king is a legitimate
tyrant, and a tyrant an illegitimate
king.  In the US, I'd hope that we,
like Samuel, wouldn't naturally make
such fine distinctions.

Note that timtest.py's current tokenizer only looks at decoded text/* MIME
sections (or raw message text if no MIME exists); spammers could put
megabytes of other crap before that and it wouldn't even be looked at
(except that the email package has to parse non-text/* parts well enough to
skip over them, and tokens for the most interesting parts of Content-{Type,
Disposition, Transfer-Encoding} decorations are generated for all MIME
sections).

Schemes that remain ignorant of MIME are vulnerable to spammers putting
arbitrary amounts of ""nice text"" in the preamble area (after the headers and
before the first MIME section), which most mail readers don't display, but

scheme.

But I don't worry about clever spammers -- I've seen no evidence that they
exist <0.5 wink>.  Even if they do, the Open Source zoo is such that no
particular scheme will gain dominance, and there's no percentage for
spammers in trying to fool just one scheme.  Even if they did, for the kind
of scheme we're using here they can't *know* what ""nice text"" is, not unless
they pay a lot of attention to the spam targets and highly tailor their
messages to each different one.  At that point they'd be doing targeted
marketing, and the cost of the game to them would increase enormously.

AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks

If you're looking to hook up with female millionaires you could try some of
the classier restaurants or clubs, but the best place of all is a certain
New York City Alcoholics Anonymous meeting.

According to a Details magazine story cited in the New York Post, ""the No.
1 location to score a megabucks babe is an Alcoholics Anonymous center on
[New York's] Upper East Side.

""It's the choicest meeting in town, right next to the Ralph Lauren store""
on Madison Avenue, which features ""rich vulnerable women,"" the mag's
October issue says.

AA officials were not overjoyed by having the address of their meeting
place published, or being cited as the ""in"" place for finding loaded women
- or rather, women who are loaded.

""The purpose of our meetings is to let people share their experiences and
help others find sobriety. It is not a place to pick up women!"" an AA
spokesman told The Post.

Here are the new scores in the 2.40 branch (they may change, but they

Total of 3.5 which is better than 7.4, I suppose.

If they fixed their MSGID, it would help.  I suppose we could allow

Optical analog computing?,"Uh, WWII Enigma was cracked at Bletchly Park, based on the work of some 
Poles, who had been trying to figure out when they would be invaded.   
Entirely mechanical!   Definitely not optical at all.    Enigma was 
originally broken based on bad use practice.  If it had been employed more 
sensibly it would have been a lot harder.

See ""The Code Book"" by Singh, Doubleday, 1999.     Or, for that matter, 
""Cryptonomicon"" by Stephenson, which is a fictionalization of the Enigma 
cracking story, and pretty accurate.

I eventually get born as a side-effect of the Battle of Britain, you 
see....

Computing with interference patterns, etc, makes perfect sense, but Enigma 
was cracked by building mechanical systems that were essentially Enigma 
machines and brute-forcing.

sprint delivers the next big thing??,"thx for the thoughts gentlemen (yes as someone said i use terms loosely) -

more than cool --->

quality: snobs only care about mpixels. this is about communications.  the
general public cares about speed not quality.  how is akamai doing these
days? not to mention any other QOS businesses that come to mind.

implementation: point about hooking to usb, wires, etc. AGREE 100%. these
implementations are super clunky, attachable camera needs to be integrated a
la nokia model.  basically useless until better handsets are released i
think.

adoption: ian brought up the 'fax' problem.  brilliant thing is, this is far
more personal than faxes so can be justified more easily and marketed in
family packs etc. but yes, the usual rules apply as MMS phones have network
efx.

content: who cares about content?  that no one can think of 'useful' content
is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users
communications.  its anything and everything.  avg person could easily send
half dozen pics to a dozen people a day.  mainly humorous i'd guess. who
cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.

display: why are dig camera displays better than cell phones?  does anyone
know who makes these small displays and what the trends are around them?

misc ramblings: i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same
thing about '1 hour photo' processing.  trivial, who needs it, i get better
resultion elswhere.  and yet, it had great decentralizing impact - the plant
had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation - the digital camera,
and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of
decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the
photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way.  also, SMS
didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less.  its
greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their SMS
traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth.  in reality,
SMS cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.

ps:  it is relatively amusing that one 'low resolution' complaint dropped
just after Joe watched a CARTOON on his television..

You're right. Or at least, I don't. I saw an advert for it on TV last
night (can't miss Futurama :-) and I thought, ""boy, that's dumb.""
If I wanted to share pictures with someone, I'd email them to them,

That begged to try it again but with Tokenize/retain_pure_html_tags false.
The random halves getting trained on and scored against are different here,

Yay!  That may mean that HTML tags aren't really needed in my test data

here is the same as the sole false positive on the half&half run reported in

a .jpg in  a URL both score as 0.99 spam clues.  Note the damning pattern of
capitalization in 'header:MiME-Version:1'!  This counting is case-sensitive,
and nobody ever would have guessed that MiME is more damning than SUBJECT or

 (almost) made easy,"Hi all,

I've decided at last to test the ALSA sound drivers. As usual the result is
that I've spent much more time repackaging the darn thing than actually
testing the functionalities or trying to hear the great sound quality
people seem to think it outputs... but hey, some of you will benefit from
that, right? ;-)

I've got the whole thing working on a Valhalla system, but the packages
should easily install or at least recompile on Enigma, Limbo/(null) and
maybe others, who knows ;-)

Here are quick instructions for those of you that wish to try it out :
- Recompile the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm for your running kernel
  (you can install the binary package if you're using the i686 2.4.18-10)
- Install this ""alsa-driver"" package
- Install the ""alsa-libs"" package
- Install the ""alsa-utils"" package

Now go to this URL and find out what you need to change in your
/etc/modules.conf file to replace the default OSS driver loading :
http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/
(very complete and very good documentation!)
Hopefully you'll see that your card *is* supported ;-)

Reboot, or remove by hand your current sound modules (you'll probably need
to stop many applications to free the sound resource...) ""by hand"" and
insert the new ones. If all is well you've got ALSA working! (""dmesg"" to
check is a good idea), you now just need to adjust the volume levels with
e.g. aumix and alsamixer because everything is muted by default.

With ""aplay"" you can already test files to see if you hear anything. You
can also install the XMMS plugin (seems to make my XMMS segfault on exit...
hmmm, but maybe it's another plugin) to listen to your good ol' mp3
files... that's it!

It really isn't complicated, and has never been from what I see. The only
thing I disliked was to have to install from source... but as I can't
imagine myself doing that ;-) I've repackaged everything cleanly. Even the
/dev entries are included in the rpm package (and *not* created by an ugly
%post script, I insist!) and seamlessly integrate into the /etc/makedev.d
structure. There are also a few other noticeable differences with the
default provided ALSA spec files, for example I've split alsa-lib's
development files into an alsa-lib-devel package and included static
libraries... there are others of course (oh yes, the kernel version against
which the ""alsa-driver"" package is compiled gets neatly integrated in the
rpm release, so does the architecture!).

I'm open to any comments or suggestions about these packages!

Download :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/

Current spec files :
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-driver/alsa-driver.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-lib/alsa-lib.spec
http://freshrpms.net/builds/alsa-utils/alsa-utils.spec
(All others, patches etc. : http://freshrpms.net/builds/ )

Matthias

PS: As an extra bonus, I've also recompiled xine with alsa support! Simply
run ""xine -A alsa09"" and off you go! It may even support 5.1 and S/PDIF ;-)

The absurdities of life.,"I call PacBell/SBC every two or three months about a recurring problem 
we have at my house:

We get a phone bill every month for someone who no longer lives at our 
house for a phone line which has been disconnected for over three years 
and the account balance is (drum roll please) $0.00! Sometimes the 
people I talk to cannot locate the account in their system and tell me 
that the phone number doesn't exist. Some people are able to locate the 
account but say that it has been disconnected and there is no way we 
could get a bill sent to us for that account. Some people can locate the 
account and verify that the line has been disconnected for three years 
and that the amount owed is $0.00 and then they say somthing along the 
lines of ""Huh?"" or ""I'm not sure what's going on... Hold please."" And 
eventually I have similar conversations with their managers and the 
account representatives and billing people and their managers and their 
managers' managers ad naseum.

The outcome of every phone call is that they'll ""look into it"" and fix 
the problem and I might receive one or two more bills depending on when 
it's resolved. So I wait a month or two and send the bills back marked 
""Not at this address, please fsck off."" and then eventually call them 
back and go through the whole process again. Lately I just explain to 
the phone jockeys that I know it's not their fault and I'm not mad at 
them and it's just not their day because I'm about to give them hell. 
Then I give them the opportunity to have me yell at their boss which 
they seem all too happy to do.

At least it gives me a positive way to vent my aggressions and it's a 
lot cheaper than seeing a therapist.

Perplexed,
Elias

Alberta, and to a lesser extent some of the other Western provinces, is
definitely not happy with the current arrangement.  Some of this has to
do with the strange way the Canadian government is structured.  When I
was last up in Alberta (a month ago), the newspapers were reporting
something like 70% of Albertans favor separating from Canada, and over
several distinct issues.

The problem is basically that while Alberta is an economic powerhouse
that is propping up the weaker economies of the Eastern provinces, their
interests are openly and unapologetically ignored by the government in
Ottawa.  While Alberta sends something like twice the tax dollars to
Ottawa per capita of the average Canadian, they only have token
representation in the federal government.  While I'm not clear on
exactly how the government works up there, representation is not
entirely based on population, and it works out that some eastern
provinces with populations smaller than the city of Calgary alone have
substantially more representatives in the legislature than the entire
province of Alberta.  

The long and the short of it is that the eastern provinces use Alberta
as a personal ATM machine for their social programs while not even so
much as throwing Alberta a bone, and are able to do so because even the
sparsely populated eastern provinces can out-vote Alberta despite having
fewer people.  Or something like that.  The Canadian government is less
restricted than the US government, so they can do strange things, like
having restrictive regulations that only apply to certain provinces,
Alberta being on the receiving end of many such obscenities.  It is
essentially a much worse version of what is happening in the
inter-mountain West of the US.  Unlike the US case though, the rest of
Canada would really be hurting if they weren't receiving all those tax
dollars from Alberta.  OTOH, Alberta would probably thrive.

I have friends in Alberta, and visit occasionally, but I'm not totally
clear on everything that goes on in that country, due to my partial
unfamiliarity with how the government works up there, so I'm a little
fuzzy on some of the details.  What I do know is that on average the
Albertans are quite unhappy with their current position in Canada and
the sentiment has been getting worse over the years.

Cheers,

is it so hard to get a cab in San Francisco?,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85519806
Date: Not supplied

A San Francisco cabbie -- generally a well-educated and firm-opinion-holding 
class of person -- has an essay about a subject near and dear to my 
(non-car-owning) heart: Why is it so damned hard to get a cab in San Francisco? 


    In fact, no cab company ever tells a driver to pick up anyone. When you 
    phone a cab firm in San Francisco, your call is treated not as an order, 
    not as a binding oral contract, but simply as a request... 

    So, why don't cab companies ensure that we pick you up on time-or at all? 
    In a nutshell, labor law states that if a cab company actually commands a 
    driver to carry out a specific action, that constitutes an 
    employer-employee relationship. But if a company farms its work out to 
    independent contractors, it can rid itself of costly expenses such as 
    disability and social security taxes. It also means that the contractor 
    drivers can't unionize.

If you said mind-numbing, rights destroying, cynic-making force, I'd
agree.  But, does politics really kill?

I'm bitter atm.  Two reasons mostly:
1) I was listening to what I heard being the First Amendment
Foundation? on NPR releasing a poll noting that their
very-unscientific poll found that half the population thinks the first
amendment goes too far.   And (their quote was 1 in 5, but I'm finding
sources of 1 in 4) of the population don't even know what rights are
guaranteed in the first amendment.

2) I have a paper due that will make or break my law school career.  I
hate being a forced sheep.

I've an XMMS Alsa module I've been using for a while now at:

http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsa-xmms-0.9_cvs020630-aap1.src.rpm

Also there is alsaplayer rpms there too:
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i386.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.i686.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71-aap1.src.rpm
http://www.dudex.net/rpms/alsaplayer-0.99.71.spec

Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of
the build. I'm running (null) RH beta now and I recall that alsa-xmms still works, I
can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild.

As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging
for many releases now.

I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these
rpms do not work on (null).

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.

'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

" Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based,

Date: Not supplied

John Robb has an interesting perspective on trust-based, targetted advertising
[1] based on his experiences at Gomez during the heady days of the Internet 
gold rush. 

Nobody believes advertisements[2] any more. There's a lot of evidence that 
advertising just doesn't work, no matter how targetted, so if you have a 
product to sell you have no choice but to get into the editorial side, where 
consumers' defenses are lowered. Product placements are one example of this. 

There is an unfortunate tragedy of the commons, here. When advertising first 
rose to prominence, advertisements _did_ work. We hadn't built up our 
immunities yet. As more and more advertisers used the opportunity of the medium 
to lie, we learned not to trust advertisements. But we still trust editorial. 
And once editorial gets polluted by desperate marketers using PR instead 
of advertising to promote their message, nobody will believe it either.

Hmmm, know what? On http://lists.freshrpms.net/ the apt-list has been up

Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used

Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)

New Sequences Window,"    Date:        Wed, 21 Aug 2002 10:40:39 -0500

  | The background color in this window is the same as the background 
  | color in the ftoc.

That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
than others.

In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
it doesn't need a different background as well.

I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
horizontal, and see what turns up.

  | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
  | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.

OK.

  | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
  | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.

In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
""all unknown"" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)


  | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
  | 
  | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.

Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
(for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
bit too similar.   I ended up using

*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
is probably safer for generic use.

Bob,

    Living aboard a Cessna 172 would be challenging, but I did meet a
couple at an airshow in Point Mugu in 1995 or so that had converted an
old seaplane (it was a bit larger than a PBY, I think) to something of a
floating, flying RV.  They visited a lot of airshows and covered a lot of
miles.  I'm sure maintenance (on a 50+ year old airframe), fuel (for two
large radial engines) insurance and other costs were out of my price
range, but what a hoot!

    On a more realistic note, the flight to Half Moon bay was probably 2
hours of flight time at about  $75/hour in the Cessna.  Not exactly a
cheap date, but that's nothing compared to the money I've spent on her
since.  (And loved every minute of it, Darling!!)

 problem) EXMH hangs during 'Query keyserver',"I guess the first question here should be does anyone have some
updates to the PGP code in EXMH that I should know about?

My current problem is that if I get a PGP signed message, I first
get a button that reads:
	""Check the signature with GnuPG""
If I punch the button, and I dont have the signature on my keyring
then I get a message saying just that, and the message:
	""Can't check signature: public key not found""
along with a button with the inscription
	""Query keyserver""
If I punch the button then EXMH just hangs.  Forever.

If instead of punching the button, I go out to the keyserver myself
and then try the message again, everything works, so it SEEMS that it
must be the code that goes out to the keyserver.

Anyone else with this problem?

What a load of crap. Politics are somehow more muddy now?  I'd say that 
its considerably
clearer - the vast majority of people feel disenfranchised, and the 
common practice of
putting protestors in boxes is done usually to hide them from TV 
cameras, visiting dignitaries,
etc, further exacerbating those feelings.
""Unpeaceably disrupting political rallies"" is now usually done by police 
with riot gear and pepper spray.

We had a good one here a month or so ago - a few people peaceably 
strayed from the permit area,
which was nearly a mile from the site of the meeting of finance 
ministers held here (the motorcade drove
by it for about 10 seconds), and were immediately gassed,  beaten and 
arrested. Not very muddied at all.

Oh, neat.

I have similiar thing in my hands, though it might be migratable if I
had the time to try. I've been using another 6.x repository though.
http://apt-rpm.tuxfamily.org/apt

Anyone tried (dist-)upgrade from 6.x to 7? Theoretically it should drop
in some -compat's (notably libc) and upgrade the rest and after a reboot
and maybe a new kernel (and grub, but I have long before put those to
v6's :) run just fine. Haven't had a spare machine to try it on myself,
though.

Kevin ""Free Kevin"" Mitnick and Steve ""Woz"" Wozniak co-hosted an episode of The 
Screen Saver on Tech TV, where Woz autographed one of the laptops that Kevin 
got arrested for using. Now that machine, signed by both net-celebs, is up for

    This is the Toshiba Satellite T1960CS, 486 laptop computer seized by the 
    FBI on February 15, 1995, in Raleigh, NC, during the arrest of the world's 
    most celebrated computer hacker, Kevin Mitnick. The laptop is working and 
    has been loaded with a fresh version of Windows 95. A shrink-wrapped 
    version of Windows 95 on floppy, is included with the laptop. The laptop is 
    a 486DX with a color LCD, detachable trackball mouse, AT&T 14.4 PCMCIA 
    modem card, power adapter and documentation in FBI evidence bags. The 
    laptop has been signed on the bottom by Steve Wozniak, co-founder of Apple 
    Computer, and says, ""You've got the whole world in your hands. --Woz (Free

Ami*/Linux Laptop:  Important details.,"Well, for one, it would free up the similar laptop I already got to
just run Amithlon (or if that wasn't so fun, bsd) to run just OpenBSD!

This is a near-term thing I could look forward to!

However, an 'official' laptop seems unexciting to me with only
the items mentioned.  Most important are the particulars distinguishing
the listed spec from a Dell 2650, preferably:
1- GeForce4 440 Go or newer, pleasingly modern GPU; the
   GeForce2Go (with 16MB video RAM; too little) I have is
   not so much too slow as inefficient; with factory settings it would
   actually crash from running too hot and too fast.
   (Accelerating the Ami* and possibly OpenUAE graphics
   is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments,
   but an energy-efficient GPU is a good sideeffect and
    portability (read: battery lifetime) enabler.)

1.5- Great control over CPU state; by use of 'internet keys'
    wired to BIOS/bhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll
    wheel.  Also, hibernate that works, please.

1.7- Bootable to USB 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones)
    in BIOS, please.

2- P4 Dells overheat.  They have a big heatsink and a little fan
   to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off
   the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will -stay- on.  Not good
  for MTBS (mean time between service; unless you've got an
  angle on making money on service from Amigans.....)
     One excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs
  behind the AMLCD, thus using the backside of the display
  half as a radiator.; though it interferes with the case notion
  below.  (yes, Aavid or such makes some as a standard part.)
      I prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative
  mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catch-handle
  and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally
  provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them
  out farther to get to the next-higher ekevation, until the sides
  of the laptop are met.)  This also happens to provide a little
  protection for USB 2  and 1394 cables that I tend to keep
  plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? Please.) 

3- A case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the
    display module NRE is entirely permissive) the capability to
    -run with the backlight off.-  Again, to save battery power, but
    also as a feature; maybe you remember the iBooks modified
   in this manner.  The user has the privilege to pull out the
   backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipe/CF assembly, with
   its backreflector, and the whole warrantee.  This provides
   for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted
   to keep depth-of-field distractions minimised.
     What would I like?  A1200 putty color, any translucency,
   in or over a rosewood-colored (in KDE color browser, I see
   chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great
   candidates) base.  
      I would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight
    without closing the lid, and to be -able- to fit an -external-
    light source such as a UV-filtered solar collector (and glare
    hood) to feed
    into the backlight.  Not only does this make an excellent 
    color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably.
      The logo should be a coloration of a
   minimal surface, as the MAA is trying to get me to renew
   with:  demos at http://astronomy.swin.edu.au/pbourke/geometry/
   at first blush.  We'll see what comes out of the contest and
   maybe you'll like the mapping MathCAD does of the
   logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the
   openness of AmigaOS, Ami* and Amiga community.
   MAA.org has more references, I'm sure.

4- Obviously Elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet.

Other details:
USB2.x preferred; FireWire would be needed if that's unavailable.
Options like 802.11b or attabhable WiFi hub for ethernet port
should round out the offering.  An option for just-released 
.13 micron P4 (with mobile power features) could make more
reviewers greenlight the series; much better power consumption,
and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that.
CompactFlash, SmartMedia and MMC flash memory card
interfaces would be very pleasant.  I've mentioned booting to
USB, and booting from CF would be a pleasant extigency also.
To that end, a backup solution with compression using
USB 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice 
bundle item; that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 OS.....


Blue skies (and clear water and fresh air): 
Waterproof to 30 feet, 3 Ethernet ports plus onboard WiFi.
Svelte; 3-line frontpanel LCD and bright red pager LED,
builtin G4 cellphone functions, choice of side and 
frontpanel trim: Ivory-like stuff inscribed with M68k memory map
and various OS 3.9 structures or textured fur that
says 'This is Amiga Speaking' when stroked 'round. 
Decent keyboard, as in Toshiba or IBM laptops; perhaps 
an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as 
keyboard and mouse) as the keyboard/trackpad.
2 Directional planar mics atop AMLCD; soundcard with multiple 
18 bit A-D and noise reduction DSP that work in our
(second-through-fourth, at least) favorite OS.
Actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation 
fan location for real void-comp (the test in Blade
Runner) style cooling and extended bass; active cooling
and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user
seat and provide mineral water.
HyperTransport ports.

The procmail bug happens when the filter program does something that 
procmail doesn't expect.  Exactly what that something is, hasn't been
confirmed by anyone on the procmail list.  It might be exiting with a
nonzero status, or it might be producing output on the standard error,
or it might be something else entirely.

So Simon is attempting to get SA to run flawlessly, because then it can't
tickle the procmail bug.  This isn't a fix, it's a band-aid, but because
he apparently doesn't have the option of installing a newer procmail ...

Strange.
Anyway, although I'd easily recommend upgrading 7.x to 7.3 using apt, I
wouldn't for 7.x to 8.0 as they are C++ binary incompatible... and apt is
entirely written in C++ and dynamically linked :-/

Still, that doesn't explain a core dump :-(

Subject: Re: [s-t] Scoot boss's wife orders hit.


the ""independent"", a shopper's newspaper in the sf bay area, (the
operational definition of that media category is ""no matter how hard

aug 24, 2002:

""Dot-com downturn linked to domestic violence""

Domestic-violence worker Kathy Black remembers watching the Nasdaq 
take a nastydive on MSNBC, in March 2000.

""I knew then that we would have a lot of work on our hands,"" Black said,
referring to the caseload at La Casa de las Madres, the city's largest
organization serving women and children affected by domestic violence.

She was right.

Using the score-ranges stuff and my aggressive anti-FP evaluation code,

I'm working with an experimental text recognition/processing engine that
exhibits similar characteristics.  It can read right through
misspellings like the above without any difficulty.  And as the author
above suggested, the pattern matching is inherently parallel internally.

If the text recognition algorithm/architecture humans use is anything
like the algorithm/structure we've been working with, the reason the
first letter (and to a lesser extent, the last letter) is important is
that without it the text pattern recognition problem is exponentially
more difficult (from a theoretical standpoint anyway) and has to be
resolved using deeper abstraction analysis.  The middle letters are far
less important and computationally much easier to resolve correctly.

I was puzzled at first, but I think I understand what happened.

First, I approved the post because it didn't appear to be spam, even
though it wasn't from a member.  I thought it was odd that someone
wanted to send the MIME blurb to the list, but it was not really that
different from causing the New York Times web site to send a story to
the list.  (Except that the bits here are antediluvian, but old bits are
a problem to be solved by social opporobrium, not technical constraints.)

But I think what actually happened is that some idiot got infected by
Klez and had both FoRK and the pine-robot autoresponder address in their
mailbox or addressbook, so Klez forged mail from fork@xent.com to the
autoresponder, which responded.  To FoRK.

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,
replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  That way you get them when you are
editing your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific
folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See
the docs for (n)mh for all the details.

There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've
been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I
load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,
to ""syntax"" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an
email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add
a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).

And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...

Oh well.  Fair enough.

Ugh, way too much manual labor.  :-)

What I've done instead is to create a tiny little ""kernel.spec"" that
installs no files but claims to produce a kernel package having version
number `uname -r` for architecture `uname -p`.  It also claims to
provide kernel-sources at the same version.  That is enough to make
alsa-driver.spec happy, and at least forms a reasonable representation
of what my homemade kernel provides to the system.  I should have
thought of this approach sooner.

One more salvo on X and cut/paste.  X specifies at least two *mechanisms*
for cut/paste, but as usual mandates no *policy*.  Windows and Macintosh
have a slightly different mechanism and one uniform policy.  I'm quite
sure that Tk implements all PRIMARY and CLIPBOARD selections accurately.
The PRIMARY selection is the one that is tied to the visible selection
on your X display.  The CLIPBOARD selection is the one with the explicit
Copy step, and is the same as what you have on Windows and Macintosh.
However, exmh throws in support for the cutbuffer mechanism, which is
another archaic mechanism supported at one point (perhaps still today)
by versions of emacs.  Exmh has a policy that tries to unify all these
mechanisms under one umbrella, and by all reports it is not that great.

I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up
with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another
setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,
that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.

Francisco caffeine tour,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85481649

Javawalk is a coffee-oriented walking-tour of San Francisco. 

    Javawalk is a two-hour walk in the city center. We start at Union Square 
    and wind through Chinatown, Jackson Square and North Beach, the city's 
    Italian district. While we cover the city's coffee roots (much more 
    significant than Seattle's!) and coffeehouse culture (think beatnik), we 
    also spend some time on San Francisco's history, interesting and arcane 
    trivia and stories the Javagirl has collected from many years of living in 
    the city. Truly, some things could only happen in SF! Javawalk also makes a 
    couple of stops at North Beach cafes for a quick java jolt. Since cool 
    weather prevails here, we need coffee year-round in the city by the Bay. 
    Lucky us!

I suppose this could finish over the course of an afternoon.  Now where's
""somewhere""?  I expect we'll eventually collect several datasets;
SourceForge isn't a good place for it (they expect projects to distribute
relatively small code files, and complain if even those get big).

What then are we training the classifier to do?  Graham's scoring scheme is
based on an assumption that the ham-vs-spam task is *easy*, and half of that
is due to that the ham has a lot in common.  It was an experiment to apply
his scheme to all the comp.lang.python traffic, which is a lot broader than
he had in mind (c.l.py has long had a generous definition of ""on topic""
<wink>).  I don't expect good things to come of making it ever broader,
*unless* your goal is to investigate just how broad it can be made before it
breaks down.

Which is ""a feature"" from Graham's POV:  the more clues, the better this
""smoking guns only"" approach should work.

Read the code <wink>.  The first line counts msgs that had 8 instances of a
'Received' header, and the second counts msgs that had 7 instances.  I
expect this is a good clue!  The more indirect the mail path, the more of
those thingies we'll see, and if you're posting from a spam trailer park in
Tasmania you may well need to travel thru more machines.

Ignoring case here may or may not help; that's for experiment to decide.
It's plausible that case is significant, if, e.g., a particular spam mailing
package generates unusual case, or a particular clueless spammer
misconfigures his package.

Rule of thumb:  if Mailman inserts a thing, I should ignore it.  Or, better,
I should stop trying to out-think the flaws in the test data and get better
test data instead!

I sucked out all the wordinfo keys that began with ""header:"".  The last line
there  was probably due to unrelated instances of the string ""header:"" in
message bodies.  Harder to guess about the first line.

The brilliance of Anthony's ""just count them"" scheme is that it requires no
thought, so can't be fooled <wink>.  Header lines that are evenly
distributed across spam and ham will turn out to be worthless indicators
(prob near 0.5), so do no harm.

I dunno if I'd accuse everybody who believes the 3K number of needing a

Date: 2002-10-07T17:59:05-05:00

_Joe Gregorio_: My next pet project[1]. &#8220;Trying to re-create the ""Good 
Easy[2]"" on a Windows machine.&#8221; I have also made half-hearted attempts in 
this direction, as I am forced to use Windows during the day. I say 
half-hearted because I'm still application-centric, and I don't go as far with 
keyboard shortcuts as I could. But I don't use the desktop at all (never have, 
on any system), and I don't use ctrl alt keyboard shortcuts because I 
personally find them awkward (YMMV). If you must use Windows, the first step 
towards a productive system is managing your Start menu. 

I use the main level of the Start menu with numbered shortcuts to my most 
common programs. ""0 Control Panel[3]"", ""1 Mozilla[4]"", ""2 Emacs[5]"", ""3 DOS 
home"", ""4 DOS work"", ""5 DOS incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, 
but in different directories), ""7 Python[6]"", ""9 IE"". Also ""# Explorer home"", 
""$ Explorer work"", ""% Explorer incoming"", which open Explorer windows in 
various useful directories (the same directories as the DOS shortcuts, only 
with the shift key held down, and yes, I intentionally set it up so that $ went 
to my work folder). Less-used programs are taken out of their useless submenus 
(as installed) and moved directly into the Programs submenu and given unique 
first letters as needed. ""Ad-aware[7]"", ""Excel[8]"", ""IM"", ""Netscape 4[9]"", 
""Paint Shop Pro"", ""Query Tool (ODBC)[10]"", ""VMWare[11]"", ""Word[12]"". All other 
submenus except Startup are removed from the Programs menu. (Yes, delete 
""Accessories"". Do you honestly ever use it? If so, it's probably a sign of a 
larger productivity problem.) Things which never need to be run manually (like 
WinZip and Quicktime) are removed from the Programs menu. Maintaining a clean 
Programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. 

On most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens 
the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your 
fingers off the home keys. Otherwise ctrl esc always works. Menu 4 gives me a 
new command prompt in my work directory. Menu P N runs Netscape 4 (for 
compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). Mozilla and Emacs are almost always 
open, but I quit lesser-used applications as soon as I'm done using them 
(mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). 

I install Cygwin[13] so that the command line is actually useful. Cygwin is a 
collection of Windows ports of all your favorite UNIX utilities, including mv, 
cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. And 
bash, which I don't use because I dislike how it handles Windows pathnames. I 
also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 
120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 
3000. Set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the 
window. 

In Mozilla, I set my home page to ""about:blank"", set Internet Search to search 
with Google, use Tabbed Browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible 
cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for 
weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the 
background). Under Scripts & Plugins, I do not allow scripts to open 
unrequested windows. I turn off the sidebar, turn on the Site Navigation Bar, 
delete all pre-installed bookmarks, and create two bookmarks: one which takes 
me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search[14], 
from which I can find all other bookmarks I need. 

In Internet Explorer, I set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since 
that's the only thing I do in Internet Explorer. alt tab back and forth between 
Mozilla and IE is easier than ctrl pgup/pgdown between tabs within Mozilla, 
since TEXTAREAs in Mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and 
pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. 

I use Emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of Emacs is 
so heinous as to render it unusable. (For instance, editing a CGI script named 
foo.cgi on a web server with Emacs would generate a foo.cgi~ backup file, which 
is world-readable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. Try this 
sometime on your favorite web site.) Among other things, my .emacs file (which 
is actually called _emacs on Windows) instructs Emacs to store all backup files 
in a single directory (d:\backup); to treat all XML files as DocBook, all CGI 
scripts as Python, and all SQL scripts as PL/SQL; to use Cygwin's bash shell 
for M-x-shell; to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the 
name of the current file; to show column numbers; to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for 
yes/no questions; not to blink; not to beep; and to close the current file when 
I press M-w. I use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get 
all text files to open in Emacs. (I got this idea from Ultraedit[15].) My 
_emacs file is my second most backed-up possession. 

I don't use Windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. On 
my D drive I have d:\home (contains directories for my books and other personal 
projects, each under CVS control&#8212;also set as my home directory using the 
HOME environment variable), d:\work (contains directories for each work 
project, also under CVS), d:\incoming (set as default download directory for 
all programs that download things), and d:\backup (used by Emacs, and for 
temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly 
created CVS projects). I don't know or care what's where on my C drive. 

I have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email 
addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal 
information in a text file called phone, stored in d:\home\phone. It is not in 
any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank 
lines between entries. I categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses 
after their name, and use M-x-occur in Emacs to search by keyword. This file is 
my single most backed-up possession. 

Other essential free Windows utilities I use (in no particular order): TweakUI
[16], Cygwin[17], Guidescope[18], ZoneAlarm[19].

My impression is that a pre-collected corpus would not fit most individuals
very well, but each individual (or group?) should collect their own corpus.

One problem that comes upp immediately: individuals are lazy.

If I currently get 50 spam and 50 ham a day, and I'll have to
press the 'delete' button once for each spam, I'll be happy
to press the 'spam' button instead.  However, if in addition
have to press a 'ham' button for each ham, it starts to look
much less like a win to me.  Add the time to install and setup
the whole machinery, and I'll just keep hitting delete.

The suggestions so far have been to hook something on the delete
action, that adds a message to the ham corpus.  I see two problems
with this: the ham will be a bit skewed; mail that I keep around
without deleting will not be counted.  Secondly, if I by force of
habit happen to press the 'delete' key instead of the 'spam' key,
I'll end up with spam in the ham, anyways.

I would like to look for a way to deal with spam in the ham.

The obvious thing to do is to trigger on the 'spam' button,
and at that time look for messages similar to the deleted one
in the ham corpus, and simply remove them.  To do this we
need a way to compare two word count histograms, to see
how similar they are.  Any ideas ?

Also, I personally would prefer to not see the spam at all.
If they get bounced (preferably already in the SMTP),
false positives become the senders problem, to rewrite
to remove the spam smell.

In a well tuned system then, there spam corpus will be much
smaller than the ham corpus, so it would be possible to be
slightly over-agressive when clearing potential spam from
the ham corpus.  This should make it easier to keep it clean.

Having a good way to remove spam from the ham corpus,
there's less need to worry about it getting there by mistake,
and we might as well simply add all messages to the ham corpus,
that didn't get deleted by the spam filtering.

It might also be useful to have a way to remove messages from
the spam corpus, in case of user ooops.

Our firmware is not built to be single-parented. You can counteract that

Thanks for the post there, it answered all my questions about
spamassassin/razor interaction.

Now for a razor question:

I'm worried about having a server full of razor-agent.log files which keep
on growing.  Is it possible to configure razor log via SYSLOG to make it
easy to rotate logs?  Searching through the man pages didn't turn anything
up...  Otherwise I'll have to write a script to go through each user's home
directory looking for razor-agent.log files to rotate periodically.

Thanks,
Dave

Robert Harley:

Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
But that obscures the different modes of
promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
money or power or companionship and the person
who uses money and power and companionship to
get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.

Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.

Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)

liberal defnitions,"
Read the article.  I'm afraid I don't understand how the transmission
prices could have hit $50/tcf.

But I'm also really leery of telling a pipeline company they have to run
a pipeline at a higher pressure and that they should forego maintenance.
We had a big pipeline explosion up here awhile ago.

So maybe the judge has a point.  We'll see as the appeals work its way
out.

Recommended Viewing,"more accurately: someone's dream changes reality for everyone, and
everyone's memory adjusts to perceive the new realities as a continuum,
replete with new pasts and new memories.

ever have dreams that ""create"" their own history to make their irrealities
plausible and authentic feeling?

ever notice how the feelings evoked in some dreams stick with you all day?
i'm sure it's some neurochemical process initiated during the dream that is
still cycling thru - like a deja vu, triggered by memory processes, where
you don't actually remember but you feel like you're remembering.

STUDENT LIFE BEGINS WITH LINUX
by
John Sterne

The launch last month of a marketing special interest group by the
Irish Linux Users Group (ILUG)  -  open source and marketing, it
seems, might not be mutually exclusive concepts  -  has already
sparked an interesting initiative at University College Cork.  When
the new academic year begins at UCC, every incoming student will
be offered a copy of Red Hat Linux 7.3.

ILUG member Braun Brelin proposed this promotion, when he ran a
training class for staff at the UCC computer science department.
Brelin, who is the director of technology at OpenApp, says that the
Linux offer could be extended to any or all of the other Irish
universities.

The user group is tapping into an international Red Hat programme
that aims to introduce students at all levels to the open source
style of computing.  The Linux distributor runs an 'educational
channel' to reach this audience, bundling educational software
with its operating environment and offering networked support
services to eligible applicants.  This scheme was originally designed
to suit the educational structures in the US, but is now available to
schools and universities throughout the world.

Red Hat Linux 7.3 incorporates ease of use and maintenance
features and is intended to counter objections that Linux is hard to
master on personal systems.

The Linux-for-all project at UCC could also raise the profile of Red
Hat Ireland.  Based in Cork, this operation has run shared financial
services for other Red Hat offices in Europe since 2000.  Until now
its involvement with users in Ireland has been fairly limited,
although it does sometimes refer them to other Red Hat offices in
Europe that offer consulting or technical support services.

David Owens, Red Hat's director of global logistics and production,
sees the formation of the ILUG marketing group as a reason to take
a more proactive approach.  In the last three months, he notes, his
office in Cork has received more and more calls from Irish
companies that are interested in adopting Linux and has introduced
some to Red Hat pre-sales consultants.


-------------
Many thanks are due to Braun and David for working together on this one.

When a Palestinian sets out, to great rejoicing, to attempt to target

rat poison.  It helps prevent blood clotting in the victims, you see.

I'm sure all those Jewish homicide-bombers do the same.  Oh wait, there

If the Palestinians are driven completely out, either by expulsion or

I did that yesterday, but seems like nobody bit.  Just in case <wink>, I

Sure thing :)

I've added to the spec some flags to remove OSS and ISA-PNP support at
build time if one wishes to, so is's possible to do a

	rpmbuild --recompile <rpm> --without oss --without isapnp

(I haven't included OSS in my 2.4.19, because VT82433 on my motherboard
is not supported :( yet, and I'm too lazy to recompile the kernel :)).

Also, having the kernel compiled by me, I have no kernel-source package
installed.  I've added a flag ""kernsrc"", that also can be used
--without, to remove the dependency for kernel-source at build time.  It
would be nice to check the correct kernel include files actually exist
(/lib/modules/`uname -r`/build/include/linux/*.h), though; however, I'm
a beginner in RPM building -- is it possible to BuildRequire for a file
not provided by a package at all?  I've googled a bit, and found no way
to do that.

I was also considering adding some sort of flag for the --with-cards
option in alsa's ./configure, but don't know how to do that.  Only found
out about --without from your first alsa-driver.spec, and existing RPM docs 
don't help much.


Oh, and one more thing :).  At first I've installed the first version of
alsa-driver for 2.4.18-10, although I don't have that kernel, to supply
the dependency for the rest of the alsa rpm's, and compiled the modules
from source.  It created the /dev files and all.

Then wanted to make my own rpm for 2.4.19, so now I'm trying to rpmbuild
the alsa-kernel package.  Removed all alsa rpms, and tried my spec:

rpmbuild --ba alsa-driver.spec.mine --without oss --without isapnp
--without kernsrc

But I get this:

Like I said, I'm a beginned with RPM building, so I don't understand
much of what's going on here.  The 00macros file is from the MAKEDEV
rpm, and alsasound was supposed to be installed by alsa-driver, I think.
   It is not in the filesystem, anyway.

I've looked in /var/tmp/alsa-driver-0.9.0rc3-root, they are there in
etc.  For 00macros I think the part that does it is this line
in alsa-driver.spec:

cp -a %{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/00macros /{buildroot}%{_sysconfdir}/makedev.d/

And alsasound is installed by %{BUILDIDR}/Makefile.


Oh, and I think I've forgot to mention, I'm running beta-null :).

My paltry 3000-message training set makes a 6.3MB (where 1MB=1e6 bytes)
pickle.  hammie.py, which I just checked in, will optionally let you
write stuff out to a dbm file.  With that same message base, the dbm
file weighs in at a hefty 21.4MB.  It also takes longer to write:

  Using a database:
   real    8m24.741s
   user    6m19.410s
   sys     1m33.650s

  Using a pickle:
   real    1m39.824s
   user    1m36.400s
   sys     0m2.160s

This is on a PIII at 551.257MHz (I don't know what it's *supposed* to
be, 551.257 is what /proc/cpuinfo says).

For comparison, SpamOracle (currently the gold standard in my mind, at
least for speed) on the same data blazes along:

   real    0m29.592s
   user    0m28.050s
   sys     0m1.180s

Its data file, which appears to be a marshalled hash, is 448KB.
However, it's compiled O'Caml and it uses a much simpler tokenizing
algorithm written with a lexical analyzer (ocamllex), so we'll never be
able to outperform it.  It's something to keep in mind, though.

I don't have statistics yet for scanning unknown messages.  (Actually, I
do, and the database blows the pickle out of the water, but it scores
every word with 0.00, so I'm not sure that's a fair test. ;)  In any
case, 21MB per user is probably too large, and 10MB is questionable.  

On the other hand, my pickle compressed very well with gzip, shrinking
down to 1.8MB.

This make me wonder about the relative protection of smart cards.  They have 
an internal procession unit around 4MHz.  Can we consider them as trusted 
hardware ?  The ability to ship smart cards periodicaly uppon cashing of a 
monthly subscription fee would not raise too much the cost of ""renting"" the 
system.  Smart card do their own self encryption.  Can they be used to 
decrypt data needed by the system ?  The input of the system could me mangled 
and the would keep a reference of how long it was in service.

This sounds really feasible but I may be totaly wrong.  I may also be wrong 
about the safety of a smart card.  

What do you think ?

Indeed, I found that strange too, then I noticed the ""-u"" switch and used
that... but your solution is much better :-) The next apt build will
incorporate this change (not worth a rebuild for this, and as some
relatively important cnc7 bugs are currently being fixed, I'd say cnc8

you look to have 2 versions of spamd installed.  The one running from
the RC script is pre-2.4 (there is a -H now, and -F has been removed),
but the one you run from the commandline seems to be a 2.4x version.

I would find that old version of SA and blow it away.

I've done this.  It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.  
I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others.  When I update the 
documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.

I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new 
functionality I'm going to add for a while.  Also, I now have pretty much 
everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much 
done.  I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and 
hopefully do nothing more afterwards.

Pg 177:
In another country, a local newspaper, intrigued by our evidence of
extralegal real estate holdings, checked to see if the head of state's
official residence had a recorded title.  It did not.

Pg 92:
The value of land in the formal sector of Lima averages US$50 per square
meter, whereas in the area of Gamarra, where a great deal of Peru's
informal manufacturing sector resides, the value per square meter can go
as high as US$3,000.

==========

I'd have made the same assumption you did.  De Soto says that isn't
correct.  You can find mansions that don't have title.  A lot of them,
in fact.  But they can't be used for collateral for a loan, or otherwise
participate as 'capital' because of their extra-legal status.

French historian Fernand Braudel (so Braudel's Bell Jar, not De Soto's)

==>

The key problem is to find out why that sector of society of the past,
which I would not hesitate to call capitalist, should have lived as if
in a bell jar, cut off from the rest; why was it not able to expand and
conquer the whole of society? ... [Why was it that] a significant rate
of capital formation was possible only in certain sectors and not in the
whole market economy of the time? ... It would perhaps be teasingly
paradoxial to say that whatever was in short supply, money certainly was
not ... so this was an age where poor land was bought up and magnificent
country residents built ... [How do we] resolve the contradiction ...
between the depressed economic climate and the splendors of Florence
under Lorenzo the Magnificent?
 

--------------

De Soto's theory is that the Bell Jar is formed when you segregate those
who have *practical* access to legal property rights and those who do
not.  The poor[1] have property -- lots and lots of property.  What they
don't have is access to the systems where we turn property into capital
and allow it to start growing.  Their property can only be exchanged
with a small section of people who know them personally.

There is absolutely no way to use a conventional 3.5"" drive with a
laptop directly. However, you can get an external firewire or USB
cradle and attach it to the laptop like that, and any 3.5"" drive
will work in that case.

I don't know a lot about ALSA, but use custom kernels for many of the 
machines -- would this mean, in order to get mplayer (eg) to work, I'd 
first have to compile a custom kernel option? or kernel module? Since I 
wouldn't have your alsa-kernel(??) installed, would that mean alsa-libs 
and so on won't install?

That's not what the First Amendment says at all. It says that Congress cannot 
say what can't be FoRKed. FoRK can establish any rules it wants. Similarly, 
The New York Times gets to choose what news IT thinks is ""fit to print."" If 
the Times chose not to print anything about, say, Rosie O'Donnell, it would 
be exercising its First Amendment rights, just as much as it would be if it 
chose to print something Rosie O'Donnell doesn't like. The necessary 
corollary of the freedom to say/publish what one wants is the freedom to 
refuse to publish or say what one doesn't like. The alternative is a 
state-controlled press that reprints government press releases and calls them 
news.

The question of what is or is not FoRKed is (except for libel or other 
specific exceptions) not a matter of law, but a matter of what the 
""publisher"" (if any) decides or the ""community"" (if any) negotiates or does 
as a matter of custom.

For my part, I'd rather people didn't use FoRK as a place in which to dump an 
expression of their political beliefs.

My French is a bit iffy these days, but if this is true, does it not also
nullify Microsoft, Adobe and WinZip licences amongst most others? These all
claim no liability, no guarantees (M$ say delivered ""with all faults"", so
at least they are honest).

Actually, if I remember correctly from discussion of the list's
composition in Forbes about five or six years ago, the *best* way to
get on the Forbes 400 is to have *no* college at all. Can you say
""Bootstraps"", boys and girls? I knew you could...

[Given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school,
like, say, mine, :-), is nothing but stuff they should have taught
you in a government-run ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of
*those* on the Forbes 400 as well as time goes on. If we ever get
around to having a good old fashioned government-collapsing
transfer-payment depression (an economic version of this summer's
government-forest conflagration, caused by the same kind of
innumeracy that not clear-cutting enough forests did out west this
summer :-)) that should motivate more than a few erst-slackers out
there, including me, :-), to learn to actually feed themselves.]


The *next* category on the Forbes 400 list is someone with a
""terminal"" professional degree, like an MBA, PhD, MD, etc., from the
best school possible.

Why? Because, as of about 1950, the *best* way to get into Harvard,
for instance, is to be *smart*, not rich. Don't take my word for it,
ask their admissions office. Look at the admissions stats over the
years for proof.

Meritocracy, American Style, was *invented* at the Ivy League after
World War II. Even Stanford got the hint, :-), and, of course,
Chicago taught them all how, right? :-). Practically *nobody* who
goes to a top-20 American institution of higher learning can actually
afford to go there these days. Unless, of course, their parents, who
couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the
last 40 years or so. And their kids *still* had to get the grades,
and ""biased"" (by intelligence :-)), test scores, to get in.


The bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""
degrees, until they actually *own* something and *hire* people, or
learn to *make* something for a living all day on a profit and loss
basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after
death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people
who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone *is*
smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.

BTW, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this
rhetorical stick can blame *me* for the fact that I'm using it to
beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. You
were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. *I* went to
Missouri, and *I* don't have a degree in anything actually useful,
much less a ""terminal"" one, which means *I*'m broker than anyone on
this list -- it's just that *you*, of all people, lots with
educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. The
facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and *look*.
There are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and
economics is not a zero-sum game. The cost of anything, including
ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,
intelligence and effort.

[I will, however, admit to being educated *waay* past my level of
competence, and, by the way *you* discuss economics, so have you,
apparently.]



BTW, if we ever actually *had* free markets in this country,
*including* the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,
all those smart people in the Forbes 400 would have *more* money, and
there would be *more* self-made people on that list. In addition,
most of the people who *inherited* money on the list would have
*much* less of it, not even relatively speaking. Finally, practically
all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and
not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.

That efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in The
People's Republics of Berkeley or Cambridge. It means more and better
stuff, cheaper, over time -- a terrible, petit-bourgeois concept
apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd
know about it by now. In economic terms, it's also called an increase
in general welfare, and, no, Virginia, I'm not talking about
extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who
doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some
politician as Santa Claus come election time...


In short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not
theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and
redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just
that: horseshit, happy or otherwise.

To believe otherwise, is -- quite literally, given the time Marx
wrote Capital and the Manifesto -- romantic nonsense.

The forums there are very informative, and there is also more info on

Well, I've made an updated libsigc++ 1.0.4 package. It rebuilds cleanly on

Supply a mod to tokenizer.py and I'll test it (eventually <wink>).  Note
that the tokenizer already *preserves* case in subject-line words, because
experiment showed that this was better than folding case away in this
specific context (but experiment also showed-- against my

this).

So, after shutting off the water and mopping up, I was left to ponder what

Er, that study would seem to lend credence to Eugen's
estimations, rather than casting fresh doubts. 

52 a year *does* exceed 300, in under 6 years' time. The average
age of that study's participants was *39* -- meaning some 
participants may have had 20-25+ years of active sex life. 

At that age, and further ** HIV+ **, it seems reasonable to
think that some the participants may have actually slowed 
their pace a bit. 

So while this study's summary info is incomplete, you could 
easily conclude that the *average* participant in this one study
will have had over a thousand partners over a 40-50+ year active 
sex life, and so the even-more-active tails of the distribution
could easily be in the 3000+ range.

Of course this says very little, almost nothing, about the overall 
population behavior, gay or straight, and the relative prevalence
of 3K+ individuals in either group. But it does strongly suggest 
that gay males with 3K+ partners exist in measurable numbers, so
people should stop treating Eugen's anecdotal estimation as if it
were sheer fantasy. BitBitch's own citation suggests otherwise.

Look for ""Zygalski sheets"".

By Koerner's* narrative, it wound up
being a hybrid affair: Bletchley had
mock Enigmas which cycled through the
Enigma's ~18k starting positions in a
quarter of an hour, but the Germans
started using a plugboard which then
had ~1.5x10^14 possibilities.  The
Poles noticed that there were some
patterns in the messages which were
only possible via certain plugboard
settings, and so:

> initial signals ..., we place them in a pile so that the squares

So the brute force hardware allowed
precalculation of ""optical"" computing
devices which then narrowed down the
possibilities enough for brute force
to again be used for daily decodes,
until:

Frankly I think this is getting close to non-acceptable since the

Anybody have any ideas where performance disappeared?

Disney has named a new president of Walt Disney Parks, replacing Paul Pressler, 
the exec who did his damnedest to ruin Disneyland, slashing spending (at the 
expense of safety and employee satisfaction), building the craptastical 
California Adventure, reducing the number of SKUs available for sale in the 
Park stores, and so on. The new president, James Rasulo, used to be head of 
Euro Disney. Link[1] Discuss[2]

What are you trying to sell???? What is the Value???

Example...Does Pratchett sell paper bound by glue or does he sell stories?



Question...When I buy a book have I purchased the story? When I sell the
book does any of that revenue go to mr Pratchett?

What if I read the book and  give it to someone, who then reads it
and gives it  to someone who then reads it and gives it to
someones....(bookcrossing.com though with  more succesfull passings). Does
each reader send Mr Pratchett money?

Have Used Bookstores, Recorstores etc destroyed the system of book/record
economy?

AS to the resident sourpuss, in germany bitter may be better but here its
just plain stinkin thinkin.

>>>From my 25+ years in the playing field, IMHO the art of job-hunting
(for those not yet de-jobbed) is the art of getting past the HR-stage
interview and into the engineer-to-engineer interview.  HR is not
being honest with you so there's no ethical quandry to be totally
honest with them: If they want experience numbers that would place you
in the OAK project, lead them to believe that you have ""something
roughly equivalent"" (ie ""it wasn't 5 years, but it was three intense
years with plenty of overtime"") -- they are playing a bluff in saying
/they/ know the job requirements so you're perfectly within poker
rules to bluff back to say you have it.

If you /don't/ have the requisite Right Stuff, the engineers can
usually suss it out pretty fast during the second interview.  Most
often, their choice is based 90% on ""who can I work with"" and only
maybe 10% on ""how much/little will we have to tutor this candidate?""

Yes, but this is what normally happened:

Engineer: we can put an input validator/parser on the backend to do 
that.

Designer: there's a JavaScript library that can do some of the 
pre-validation.

Creative Director: I want it in blue, with a zooming logo.

Engineer: can we get to that later, we need to meet functional specs.

Creative Director: You *don't* understand. *I* want it in blue.

Creative Director: Oh, and the site launches this Friday because I sent 
out a press release about our new strategic partnership with HypeCorp.

Designer: fine, we'll just put a list of countries in a drop down.

Engineer: and we can validate against that list.

Creative Director: I don't give a shit. As long as it's in blue. And 
has a link to my press release.

I reran the experiment (with the new SpamHam1.pik, but it doesn't seem
to make a difference).  Here are the clues for the two spams in my
inbox (in hammie.py's output format, which sorts the clues by
probability; the first two numbers are the message number and overall
probability; then line-folded):

    'economy""': 0.99

This has 6 content-types as spam clues, only one of which is related
to HTML, despite there being an HTML alternative (and 12 other spam
clues, vs. only 6 ham clues).  This was an announcement of a public
event by our building owners, with a text part that was the same as
the HTML (AFAICT).  Its language may be spammish, but the content-type
clues didn't help.  (BTW, it makes me wonder about the wisdom of
keeping punctuation -- 'economy' and 'economy""' to me don't seem to
deserve two be counted as clues.)

I've been looking into hotels.  I poked around expedia for availability
from March 26 to 29 (4 nights, wednesday thorugh saturday).  

I've also started contacting hotels for group rates; some of the group
rates are no better than the regular rates, and they require signing a
contract with a minimum number of rooms sold (with someone financially
responsible for unbooked rooms).  Most hotels are less than responsive...

	Radission - Barcelo Hotel (DuPont Circle)
	$125/night, $99/weekend

	State Plaza hotel (Foggy Bottom; near GWU)
	$119/night, $99/weekend

	Hilton Silver Spring (Near Metro, in suburban MD)
	$99/hight, $74/weekend

	Windsor Park Hotel
	Conn Ave, between DuPont Circle/Woodley Park Metro stations
	$95/night; needs a car

	Econo Lodge Alexandria (Near Metro, in suburban VA)
	$95/night

This is a hand picked list; I ignored anything over $125/night, even
though there are some really well situated hotels nearby at higher rates.
Also, I'm not sure how much these prices reflect an expedia-only
discount.  I can't vouch for any of these hotels, either.

I also found out that the down season for DC Hotels are mid-june through
mid-september, and mid-november through mid-january.

""""""

This one has no MIME structure nor HTML!  It even has a
Content-disposition which is counted as a non-spam clue.  It got
f-p'ed because of the many hospitality-related and money-related
terms.  I'm surprised $125/night and similar aren't clues too.  (And
again, several spam clues are duplicated with different variations:
'hotel', 'hotels', 'hotels.', 'subject:Hotel', 'rates,', 'rates.'.

I also looked in more detail at some f-p's in my geeks traffic.  The
first one's a doozie (that's the term, right? :-).  It has lots of
HTML clues that are apparently ignored.  It was a multipart/mixed with
two parts: a brief text/plain part containing one or two sentences, a
mondo weird URL:

http://x60.deja.com/[ST_rn=ps]/getdoc.xp?AN=687715863&CONTEXT=973121507.1408827441&hitnum=23

and some employer-generated spammish boilerplate; the second part was
the HTML taken directly from the above URL.  Clues:

The second f-p had the same structure (and sender :-); the third f-p
had the same structure and a different sender.  Ditto the fifth, sixth.  (Not posting clues for
brevity.)

The fourth was different: plaintext with one very short sentence and a
URL.  Clues:

The seventh was similar.

I scanned a bunch more until I got bored, and most of them were either
of the first form (brief text with URL followed by quoted HTML from
website) or the second (brief text with one or more URLs).

It's up to you to decide what to call this, but I think these are none
of your #1, #2 or #3 (they're close to #3, but all are multipart/mixed
rather than multipart/alternative).

It's possible that the corpus you've trained on is more homogeneous

Hmmm, my last message doesn't seem to have made it into bugzilla yet.

I've committed a patch to fix this problem in both HEAD and b2_4_0.  The last

Yes, it is...  But then alsa-driver requires alsa-kernel, and I don't quite

That's ok.  I was only considering it for the sake of tweaking anyway, not

Um...  I keep 2.4.18-12.2 for emergency sitations (like I forget to include 
keyboard support in kernel, dumb me), but alsa-kernel_2.4.18-10 does not 
require kernel-2.4.18-10, so that's ok.

I am now preparing a small patch to configure.in for NetBSD (possibly
also useful for Open- and FreeBSD, don't know). Should be ready and
tested in the next half hour.

If you think 2.40 is ready, I would suggest to wait just 24 hours more
for possible reports by b2_4_0 users. Not everyone can follow the
development during daytime (at work).

Absolutely correct. Perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about 
life on Earth today.

The following is a fascinating document of official Government policy 
that bears close reading. It is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in 
an imperfect world.

I was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of Radio Sawa, 
our new music-and-news channel for 15-30 year old Arabs. It's #1 in 
practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in 
Amman. And it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past BBC and 
taking share from every other government broadcaster.

It is as hard to imagine America losing a war of ideas in the long-term 
as it is to imagine America making any headway at all in the short term.

Many of you may disagree, but I found the document below surprisingly 
centrist. If you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re: 
ICC, Taiwan Relations Act, etc. But, still, this is as much a Democratic 
platform as not. Africa and AIDS take up more mindshare than I feared 
they might.

As you read, replace ""United States"" with ""Roman Empire"" and it may make 
as much sense, in the long view of history. I don't know how proud to be 
about that, but it is telling. Sometime I daydream that the President 
might sit down with the nation with Perotista flip charts and explain to 
our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700+ military installations 
overseas and what they do for us. It would be a powerful education on 
how engaged we are in the world around us.

Heck, I'd love to see a real-time map of Federal expenditures around the 
globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research 
stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all 
the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.

Of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the 
real news in this document: the Bush Doctrine for pre-emptive strikes. 
I'd sooner repeal the Church amendments on covert action than permit 
such a principle to be loosed upon the world.

Full Text: Bush's National Security Strategy

Following is the full text of President Bush's new national security 
strategy. The document, entitled ""The National Security Strategy of the 
United States,"" will soon be transmitted to Congress as a declaration of 
the Administration's policy.

INTRODUCTION

THE great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and 
totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of 
freedom -- and a single sustainable model for national success: freedom, 
democracy, and free enterprise. In the twenty-first century, only 
nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and 
guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the 
potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. People 
everywhere want to say what they think; choose who will govern them; 
worship as they please; educate their children -- male and female; own 
property; and enjoy the benefits of their labor. These values of freedom 
are right and true for every person, in every society -- and the duty of 
protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of 
freedom-loving people across the globe and across the ages.

Today, the United States enjoys a position of unparalleled military 
strength and great economic and political influence. In keeping with our 
heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for 
unilateral advantage. We seek instead to create a balance of power that 
favors human freedom: conditions in which all nations and all societies 
can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and 
economic liberty. By making the world safer, we allow the people of the 
world to make their own lives better. We will defend this just peace 
against threats from terrorists and tyrants. We will preserve the peace 
by building good relations among the great powers. We will extend the 
peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.

Defending our Nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental 
commitment of the Federal Government. Today, that task has changed 
dramatically. Enemies in the past needed great armies and great 
industrial capabilities to endanger America. Now, shadowy networks of 
individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less 
than it costs to purchase a single tank. Terrorists are organized to 
penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies 
against us.

To defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal -- 
from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and 
cutting off terrorist financing. The war against terrorists of global 
reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. America will help 
nations that need our assistance in combating terror. And America will 
hold to account nations that are compromised by terror -- because the 
allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. The United States and 
countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop 
new home bases. Together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every 
turn.

The gravest danger our Nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism 
and technology. Our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking 
weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing 
so with determination. The United States will not allow these efforts to 
succeed. We will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other 
means of delivery. We will cooperate with other nations to deny, 
contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous 
technologies. And, as a matter of common sense and self-defense, America 
will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. We 
cannot defend America and our friends by hoping for the best. So we must 
be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence 
and proceeding with deliberation. History will judge harshly those who 
saw this coming danger but failed to act. In the new world we have 
entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.

As we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic 
opportunity to preserve the peace. Today, the international community 
has the best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 
seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace 
instead of continually prepare for war. Today, the world's great powers 
find ourselves on the same side -- united by common dangers of terrorist 
violence and chaos. The United States will build on these common 
interests to promote global security. We are also increasingly united by 
common values. Russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching 
for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. Chinese 
leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of 
national wealth. In time, they will find that social and political 
freedom is the only source of national greatness. America will encourage 
the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, 
because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and 
international order. We will strongly resist aggression from other great 
powers -- even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, 
trade, and cultural advancement.

Finally, the United States will use this moment of opportunity to extend 
the benefits of freedom across the globe. We will actively work to bring 
the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to 
every corner of the world. The events of September 11, 2001, taught us 
that weak states, like Afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our 
national interests as strong states. Poverty does not make poor people 
into terrorists and murderers. Yet poverty, weak institutions, and 
corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and 
drug cartels within their borders.

The United States will stand beside any nation determined to build a 
better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. Free 
trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies 
out of poverty -- so the United States will work with individual 
nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to 
build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. 
The United States will deliver greater development assistance through 
the New Millennium Challenge Account to nations that govern justly, 
invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. We will also 
continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of 
AIDS and other infectious diseases.

In building a balance of power that favors freedom, the United States is 
guided by the conviction that all nations have important 
responsibilities. Nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. 
Nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the 
spread of weapons of mass destruction. Nations that seek international 
aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. For 
freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.

We are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, 
better world alone. Alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply 
the strength of freedom-loving nations. The United States is committed 
to lasting institutions like the United Nations, the World Trade 
Organization, the Organization of American States, and NATO as well as 
other long-standing alliances. Coalitions of the willing can augment 
these permanent institutions. In all cases, international obligations 
are to be taken seriously. They are not to be undertaken symbolically to 
rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.

Freedom is the non-negotiable demand of human dignity; the birthright of 
every person -- in every civilization. Throughout history, freedom has 
been threatened by war and terror; it has been challenged by the 
clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants; and 
it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. Today, humanity 
holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all 
these foes. The United States welcomes our responsibility to lead in 
this great mission.

I. Overview of America's International Strategy


""Our Nation's cause has always been larger than our Nation's defense. We 
fight, as we always fight, for a just peace -- a peace that favors 
liberty. We will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists 
and tyrants. We will preserve the peace by building good relations among 
the great powers. And we will extend the peace by encouraging free and 
open societies on every continent.""






President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



The United States possesses unprecedented -- and unequaled -- strength 
and influence in the world. Sustained by faith in the principles of 
liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with 
unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. The great 
strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that 
favors freedom.

For most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great 
struggle over ideas: destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and 
equality.

That great struggle is over. The militant visions of class, nation, and 
race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and 
discredited. America is now threatened less by conquering states than we 
are by failing ones. We are menaced less by fleets and armies than by 
catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. We must 
defeat these threats to our Nation, allies, and friends.

This is also a time of opportunity for America. We will work to 
translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, 
and liberty. The U.S. national security strategy will be based on a 
distinctly American internationalism that reflects the union of our 
values and our national interests. The aim of this strategy is to help 
make the world not just safer but better. Our goals on the path to 
progress are clear: political and economic freedom, peaceful relations 
with other states, and respect for human dignity.

And this path is not America's alone. It is open to all.

To achieve these goals, the United States will:

*	champion aspirations for human dignity;

*	strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent 
attacks against us and our friends;

*	work with others to defuse regional conflicts;

*	prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our 
friends, with weapons of mass destruction;

*	ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and 
free trade;

*	expand the circle of development by opening societies and building 
the infrastructure of democracy;

*	develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of 
global power; and

*	transform America's national security institutions to meet the 
challenges and opportunities of the twenty-first century.


II. Champion Aspirations for Human Dignity


""Some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the 
language of right and wrong. I disagree. Different circumstances require 
different methods, but not different moralities.""





President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



In pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we 
stand for: the United States must defend liberty and justice because 
these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. No nation 
owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. Fathers and 
mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live 
free from poverty and violence. No people on earth yearn to be 
oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of 
the secret police.

America must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human 
dignity: the rule of law; limits on the absolute power of the state; 
free speech; freedom of worship; equal justice; respect for women; 
religious and ethnic tolerance; and respect for private property.

These demands can be met in many ways. America's constitution has served 
us well. Many other nations, with different histories and cultures, 
facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these 
core principles into their own systems of governance. History has not 
been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and 
aspirations of their people.

Our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. But even in 
our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the Declaration of 
Independence were there to guide us. As a result, America is not just a 
stronger, but is a freer and more just society.

Today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. And 
when openings arrive, we can encourage change -- as we did in central 
and eastern Europe between 1989 and 1991, or in Belgrade in 2000. When 
we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in Taiwan or in 
the Republic of Korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in Latin 
America and Africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can 
evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all 
cherish.

Embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, 
the national security strategy of the United States must start from 
these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.

Our principles will guide our government's decisions about international 
cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation 
of resources. They will guide our actions and our words in international 
bodies.

We will:

*	speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of 
human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to 
advance freedom;

*	use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who 
struggle non-violently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward 
democracy are rewarded for the steps they take;

*	make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key 
themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation 
from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights 
to move toward a better future; and

*	take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience 
and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.


We will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist 
it.

III. Strengthen Alliances to Defeat Global Terrorism and Work to Prevent 
Attacks Against Us and Our Friends


""Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have 
the distance of history. But our responsibility to history is already 
clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. War has been 
waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is 
peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. The conflict was begun on 
the timing and terms of others. It will end in a way, and at an hour, of 
our choosing.""





President Bush
Washington, D.C. (The National Cathedral)
September 14, 2001



The United States of America is fighting a war against terrorists of 
global reach. The enemy is not a single political regime or person or 
religion or ideology. The enemy is terrorism -- premeditated, 
politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.

In many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a 
lasting peace. Such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed 
within a political process. But no cause justifies terror. The United 
States will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals 
with them. We make no distinction between terrorists and those who 
knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.

The struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in 
our history. It will be fought on many fronts against a particularly 
elusive enemy over an extended period of time. Progress will come 
through the persistent accumulation of successes -- some seen, some 
unseen.

Today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, 
and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to 
achieve their political goals. Afghanistan has been liberated; coalition 
forces continue to hunt down the Taliban and al-Qaida. But it is not 
only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. Thousands of 
trained terrorists remain at large with cells in North America, South 
America, Europe, Africa, the Middle East, and across Asia.

Our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist 
organizations of global reach and attack their leadership; command, 
control, and communications; material support; and finances. This will 
have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.

We will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a 
coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. Once the regional 
campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure 
the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial 
tools necessary to finish the task.

The United States will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the 
financing of terrorism. We will identify and block the sources of 
funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who 
support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial 
system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, 
and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative 
financial networks.

However, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the 
cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we 
seek.

We will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by:

*	direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and 
international power. Our immediate focus will be those terrorist 
organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of 
terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction 
(WMD) or their precursors;

*	defending the United States, the American people, and our interests 
at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it 
reaches our borders. While the United States will constantly strive to 
enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate 
to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of self-defense by 
acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing 
harm against our people and our country; and

*	denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists 
by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign 
responsibilities.


We will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international 
terrorism. This includes:

*	using the full influence of the United States, and working closely 
with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are 
illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as 
slavery, piracy, or genocide: behavior that no respectable government 
can condone or support and all must oppose;

*	supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the Muslim 
world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote 
terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation;

*	diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by 
enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources 
on areas most at risk; and

*	using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of 
information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of 
those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.


While we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also 
strengthening America's homeland security to protect against and deter 
attack.

This Administration has proposed the largest government reorganization 
since the Truman Administration created the National Security Council 
and the Department of Defense. Centered on a new Department of Homeland 
Security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental 
reordering of the FBI, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland 
encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public 
and the private sector.

This strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. For example, 
emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with 
terrorism but with all hazards. Our medical system will be strengthened 
to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and 
mass-casualty dangers. Our border controls will not just stop 
terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.

While our focus is protecting America, we know that to defeat terrorism 
in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. 
Wherever possible, the United States will rely on regional organizations 
and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. Where 
governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we 
will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and 
our allies can provide.

As we pursue the terrorists in Afghanistan, we will continue to work 
with international organizations such as the United Nations, as well as 
non-governmental organizations, and other countries to provide the 
humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to 
rebuild Afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, 
threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists

In the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are 
ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. Freedom 
and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this 
conflict. In leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, 
productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in 
ways that meet the challenges of the twenty-first century.

IV. Work with Others To Defuse Regional Conflicts


""We build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. 
The magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements 
look so small.""





President Bush
Berlin, Germany
May 23, 2002



Concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional 
disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. In 
an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our 
alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create 
horrifying affronts to human dignity. When violence erupts and states 
falter, the United States will work with friends and partners to 
alleviate suffering and restore stability.

No doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which U.S. action -- 
direct or indirect -- is warranted. We have finite political, economic, 
and military resources to meet our global priorities. The United States 
will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind:

*	The United States should invest time and resources into building 
international relationships and institutions that can help manage local 
crises when they emerge.

*	The United States should be realistic about its ability to help 
those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. Where and when 
people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.


Policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will 
apply these principles:

The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of 
human suffering, because of America's close relationship with the state 
of Israel and key Arab states, and because of that region's importance 
to other global priorities of the United States. There can be no peace 
for either side without freedom for both sides. America stands committed 
to an independent and democratic Palestine, living beside Israel in 
peace and security. Like all other people, Palestinians deserve a 
government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and 
counts their votes. The United States will continue to encourage all 
parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and 
comprehensive settlement to the conflict.

The United States, the international donor community, and the World Bank 
stand ready to work with a reformed Palestinian government on economic 
development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to 
establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. If 
Palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront 
corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on American support 
for the creation of a Palestinian state.

Israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic Palestine. 
Permanent occupation threatens Israel's identity and democracy. So the 
United States continues to challenge Israeli leaders to take concrete 
steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible Palestinian state. 
As there is progress towards security, Israel forces need to withdraw 
fully to positions they held prior to September 28, 2000. And consistent 
with the recommendations of the Mitchell Committee, Israeli settlement 
activity in the occupied territories must stop. As violence subsides, 
freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent Palestinians 
to resume work and normal life. The United States can play a crucial 
role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when Israelis and 
Palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.

In South Asia, the United States has also emphasized the need for India 
and Pakistan to resolve their disputes. This administration invested 
time and resources building strong bilateral relations with India and 
Pakistan. These strong relations then gave us leverage to play a 
constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. With 
Pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by Pakistan's 
choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more 
open and tolerant society. The Administration sees India's potential to 
become one of the great democratic powers of the twenty-first century 
and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. Our 
involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in 
bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by India and Pakistan 
that can help defuse military confrontation.

Indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and 
respect for the rule of law. By tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting 
the rule of law, and accepting open markets, Indonesia may be able to 
employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its 
neighbors out of poverty and desperation. It is the initiative by 
Indonesia that allows U.S. assistance to make a difference.

In the Western Hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with 
countries that share our priorities, particularly Mexico, Brazil, 
Canada, Chile, and Colombia. Together we will promote a truly democratic 
hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, 
opportunity, and hope. We will work with regional institutions, such as 
the Summit of the Americas process, the Organization of American States 
(OAS), and the Defense Ministerial of the Americas for the benefit of 
the entire hemisphere.

Parts of Latin America confront regional conflict, especially arising 
from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. This conflict 
and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and 
security of the United States. Therefore we have developed an active 
strategy to help the Andean nations adjust their economies, enforce 
their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of 
drugs, while -- as important -- we work to reduce the demand for drugs 
in our own country.

In Colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist 
groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking 
activities that help finance the operations of such groups. We are 
working to help Colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat 
illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective 
sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic 
security to the Colombian people.

In Africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, 
and desperate poverty. This threatens both a core value of the United 
States -- preserving human dignity -- and our strategic priority -- 
combating global terror. American interests and American principles, 
therefore, lead in the same direction: we will work with others for an 
African continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. 
Together with our European allies, we must help strengthen Africa's 
fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous 
borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence 
infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.

An ever more lethal environment exists in Africa as local civil wars 
spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. Forming coalitions 
of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to 
confronting these emerging transnational threats.

Africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that 
focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. This 
administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the 
region:

*	countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as South 
Africa, Nigeria, Kenya, and Ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement 
and require focused attention;

*	coordination with European allies and international institutions is 
essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace 
operations; and

*	Africa's capable reforming states and sub-regional organizations 
must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational 
threats on a sustained basis.


Ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the 
surest route to progress in sub-Saharan Africa, where most wars are 
conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically 
waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. The transition to 
the African Union with its stated commitment to good governance and a 
common responsibility for democratic political systems offers 
opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.

V. Prevent Our Enemies from Threatening Us, Our Allies, and Our Friends 
with Weapons of Mass Destruction


""The gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and 
technology. When the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear 
weapons, along with ballistic missile technology -- when that occurs, 
even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to 
strike great nations. Our enemies have declared this very intention, and 
have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. They want the 
capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends -- and 
we will oppose them with all our power.""





President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



The nature of the Cold War threat required the United States -- with our 
allies and friends -- to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of 
force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. With the 
collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, our security 
environment has undergone profound transformation.

Having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our 
relationship with Russia, the dividends are evident: an end to the 
balance of terror that divided us; an historic reduction in the nuclear 
arsenals on both sides; and cooperation in areas such as 
counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were 
inconceivable.

But new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. 
None of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power 
that was arrayed against us by the Soviet Union. However, the nature and 
motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain 
destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest 
states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass 
destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex 
and dangerous.

In the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue 
states that, while different in important ways, share a number of 
attributes. These states:

*	brutalize their own people and squander their national resources 
for the personal gain of the rulers;

*	display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, 
and callously violate international treaties to which they are party;

*	are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with 
other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively 
to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes;

*	sponsor terrorism around the globe; and

*	reject basic human values and hate the United States and everything 
for which it stands.


At the time of the Gulf War, we acquired irrefutable proof that Iraq's 
designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against 
Iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear 
weapons and biological agents. In the past decade North Korea has become 
the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested 
increasingly capable missiles while developing its own WMD arsenal. 
Other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as 
well. These states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has 
become a looming threat to all nations.

We must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients 
before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction 
against the United States and our allies and friends. Our response must 
take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new 
partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military 
forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective 
missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence 
collection and analysis.

Our comprehensive strategy to combat WMD includes:

*	Proactive counterproliferation efforts. We must deter and defend 
against the threat before it is unleashed. We must ensure that key 
capabilities -- detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce 
capabilities -- are integrated into our defense transformation and our 
homeland security systems. Counterproliferation must also be integrated 
into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of 
our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with WMD-armed 
adversaries.

*	Strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and 
terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise 
necessary for weapons of mass destruction. We will enhance diplomacy, 
arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction 
assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking WMD, and when 
necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. We will 
continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their 
increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and 
threat reduction programs. The recent G-8 agreement to commit up to $20 
billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step 
forward.

*	Effective consequence management to respond to the effects of WMD 
use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. Minimizing the effects of 
WMD use against our people will help deter those who possess such 
weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading 
enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. The United States 
must also be prepared to respond to the effects of WMD use against our 
forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.


It has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of 
this new threat. Given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the 
United States can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have 
in the past. The inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy 
of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be 
caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. 
We cannot let our enemies strike first.

*	In the Cold War, especially following the Cuban missile crisis, we 
faced a generally status quo, risk-averse adversary. Deterrence was an 
effective defense. But deterrence based only upon the threat of 
retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states 
more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and 
the wealth of their nations.

*	In the Cold War, weapons of mass destruction were considered 
weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who 
used them. Today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons 
of choice. For rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and 
military aggression against their neighbors. These weapons may also 
allow these states to attempt to blackmail the United States and our 
allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior 
of rogue states. Such states also see these weapons as their best means 
of overcoming the conventional superiority of the United States.

*	Traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a 
terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the 
targeting of innocents; whose so-called soldiers seek martyrdom in death 
and whose most potent protection is statelessness. The overlap between 
states that sponsor terror and those that pursue WMD compels us to 
action.


For centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer 
an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves 
against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. Legal scholars 
and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption 
on the existence of an imminent threat -- most often a visible 
mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.

We must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and 
objectives of today's adversaries. Rogue states and terrorists do not 
seek to attack us using conventional means. They know such attacks would 
fail. Instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use 
of weapons of mass destruction -- weapons that can be easily concealed 
and delivered covertly and without warning.

The targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian 
population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law 
of warfare. As was demonstrated by the losses on September 11, 2001, 
mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and 
these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired 
and used weapons of mass destruction.

The United States has long maintained the option of preemptive actions 
to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. The greater the 
threat, the greater is the risk of inaction -- and the more compelling 
the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if 
uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. To 
forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the United 
States will, if necessary, act preemptively.

The United States will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging 
threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. 
Yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek 
the world's most destructive technologies, the United States cannot 
remain idle while dangers gather.

We will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our 
actions. To support preemptive options, we will:

*	build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide 
timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge;

*	coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the 
most dangerous threats; and

*	continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to 
conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.


The purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat 
to the United States or our allies and friends. The reasons for our 
actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.

VI. Ignite a New Era of Global Economic Growth through Free Markets and 
Free Trade.


""When nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a 
privileged few, no amount -- no amount -- of development aid is ever 
enough. When nations respect their people, open markets, invest in 
better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade 
revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.""





President Bush
Monterrey, Mexico
March 22, 2002



A strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing 
prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. Economic growth 
supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher 
incomes. It allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs 
economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it 
reinforces the habits of liberty.

We will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond America's 
shores. All governments are responsible for creating their own economic 
policies and responding to their own economic challenge. We will use our 
economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of 
policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic 
growth, including:

*	pro-growth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business 
investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity;

*	tax policies -- particularly lower marginal tax rates -- that 
improve incentives for work and investment;

*	rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are 
confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic 
endeavors;

*	strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most 
efficient use;

*	sound fiscal policies to support business activity;

*	investments in health and education that improve the well-being and 
skills of the labor force and population as a whole; and

*	free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the 
diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and 
opportunity.


The lessons of history are clear: market economies, not 
command-and-control economies with the heavy hand of government, are the 
best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. Policies that further 
strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for 
all economies -- industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the 
developing world.

A return to strong economic growth in Europe and Japan is vital to U.S. 
national security interests. We want our allies to have strong economies 
for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake 
of global security. European efforts to remove structural barriers in 
their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are 
Japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of 
non-performing loans in the Japanese banking system. We will continue to 
use our regular consultations with Japan and our European partners -- 
including through the Group of Seven (G-7) -- to discuss policies they 
are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher 
global economic growth.

Improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic 
growth. International flows of investment capital are needed to expand 
the productive potential of these economies. These flows allow emerging 
markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise 
living standards and reduce poverty. Our long-term objective should be a 
world in which all countries have investment-grade credit ratings that 
allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in 
their future.

We are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve 
access to larger capital flows at lower cost. To this end, we will 
continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial 
markets. We will work actively with other countries, the International 
Monetary Fund (IMF), and the private sector to implement the G-7 Action 
Plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and 
more effectively resolving them when they occur.

The best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from 
occurring, and we have encouraged the IMF to improve its efforts doing 
so. We will continue to work with the IMF to streamline the policy 
conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on 
achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, 
exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.

The concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it 
became a pillar of economics. If you can make something that others 
value, you should be able to sell it to them. If others make something 
that you value, you should be able to buy it. This is real freedom, the 
freedom for a person -- or a nation -- to make a living. To promote free 
trade, the Unites States has developed a comprehensive strategy:

*	Seize the global initiative. The new global trade negotiations we 
helped launch at Doha in November 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, 
especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for 
completion in 2005. The United States has led the way in completing the 
accession of China and a democratic Taiwan to the World Trade 
Organization. We will assist Russia's preparations to join the WTO.

*	Press regional initiatives. The United States and other democracies 
in the Western Hemisphere have agreed to create the Free Trade Area of 
the Americas, targeted for completion in 2005. This year the United 
States will advocate market-access negotiations with its partners, 
targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and 
government procurement. We will also offer more opportunity to the 
poorest continent, Africa, starting with full use of the preferences 
allowed in the African Growth and Opportunity Act, and leading to free 
trade.

*	Move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. Building on the 
free trade agreement with Jordan enacted in 2001, the Administration 
will work this year to complete free trade agreements with Chile and 
Singapore. Our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of 
developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. 
Initially, Central America, Southern Africa, Morocco, and Australia will 
be our principal focal points.

*	Renew the executive-congressional partnership. Every 
administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with 
Congress. After a gap of 8 years, the Administration reestablished 
majority support in the Congress for trade liberalization by passing 
Trade Promotion Authority and the other market opening measures for 
developing countries in the Trade Act of 2002. This Administration will 
work with Congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade 
agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed Trade 
Promotion Authority.

*	Promote the connection between trade and development. Trade 
policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, 
competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open 
societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional 
integration -- all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in 
developing countries. The United States is implementing The Africa 
Growth and Opportunity Act to provide market-access for nearly all goods 
produced in the 35 countries of sub-Saharan Africa. We will make more 
use of this act and its equivalent for the Caribbean Basin and continue 
to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer 
countries take advantage of these opportunities. Beyond market access, 
the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public 
health. We will ensure that the WTO intellectual property rules are 
flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical 
medicines for extraordinary dangers like HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and 
malaria.

*	Enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. 
Commerce depends on the rule of law; international trade depends on 
enforceable agreements. Our top priorities are to resolve ongoing 
disputes with the European Union, Canada, and Mexico and to make a 
global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations 
that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. Laws 
against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international 
community must be able to address genuine concerns about government 
subsidies and dumping. International industrial espionage which 
undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.

*	Help domestic industries and workers adjust. There is a sound 
statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used 
in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the 
American steel industry. The benefits of free trade depend upon the 
enforcement of fair trading practices. These safeguards help ensure that 
the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of American 
workers. Trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the 
change and dynamism of open markets.

*	Protect the environment and workers. The United States must foster 
economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with 
widening prosperity. We will incorporate labor and environmental 
concerns into U.S. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network"" 
between multilateral environmental agreements with the WTO, and use the 
International Labor Organization, trade preference programs, and trade 
talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.

*	Enhance energy security. We will strengthen our own energy security 
and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our 
allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and 
types of global energy supplied, especially in the Western Hemisphere, 
Africa, Central Asia, and the Caspian region. We will also continue to 
work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient 
technologies.


Economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize 
greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing 
them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the 
global climate. Our overall objective is to reduce America's greenhouse 
gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such 
emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 
years, by the year 2012. Our strategies for attaining this goal will be 
to:

*	remain committed to the basic U.N. Framework Convention for 
international cooperation;

*	obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of 
the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to 
companies that can show real cuts;

*	develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission 
reductions;

*	promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as 
well as nuclear power -- which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, 
while also improving fuel economy for U.S. cars and trucks;

*	increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to 
a total of $4.5 billion -- the largest sum being spent on climate change 
by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's 
budget; and

*	assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas 
emitters such as China and India, so that they will have the tools and 
resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and 
better path.


VII. Expand the Circle of Development by Opening Societies and Building 
the Infrastructure of Democracy


""In World War II we fought to make the world safer, then worked to 
rebuild it. As we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we 
must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""





President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Inter-American
Development Bank)
March 14, 2002



A world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human 
race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. Including 
all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development -- and 
opportunity -- is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of 
U.S. international policy.

Decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic 
growth in the poorest countries. Worse, development aid has often served 
to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and 
perpetuating misery. Results of aid are typically measured in dollars 
spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction 
achieved by recipients. These are the indicators of a failed strategy.

Working with other nations, the United States is confronting this 
failure. We forged a new consensus at the U.N. Conference on Financing 
for Development in Monterrey that the objectives of assistance -- and 
the strategies to achieve those objectives -- must change.

This Administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential 
of individuals in all nations. Sustained growth and poverty reduction is 
impossible without the right national policies. Where governments have 
implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels 
of assistance. The United States and other developed countries should 
set an ambitious and specific target: to double the size of the world's 
poorest economies within a decade.

The United States Government will pursue these major strategies to 
achieve this goal:

*	Provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of 
national reform. We propose a 50 percent increase in the core 
development assistance given by the United States. While continuing our 
present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, 
these billions of new dollars will form a new Millennium Challenge 
Account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest 
in their people, and encourage economic freedom. Governments must fight 
corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest 
in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and 
enable entrepreneurship. The Millennium Challenge Account will reward 
countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those 
that have not to implement reforms.

*	Improve the effectiveness of the World Bank and other development 
banks in raising living standards. The United States is committed to a 
comprehensive reform agenda for making the World Bank and the other 
multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of 
the world's poor. We have reversed the downward trend in U.S. 
contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the U.S. 
contributions to the International Development Association (IDA) -- the 
World Bank's fund for the poorest countries -- and the African 
Development Fund. The key to raising living standards and reducing 
poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially 
in the poorest countries. We will continue to press the multilateral 
development banks to focus on activities that increase economic 
productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, 
and private sector development. Every project, every loan, every grant 
must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in 
developing countries.

*	Insist upon measurable results to ensure that development 
assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's 
poor. When it comes to economic development, what really matters is that 
more children are getting a better education, more people have access to 
health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a 
better future for their families. We have a moral obligation to measure 
the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering 
results. For this reason, we will continue to demand that our own 
development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral 
development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for 
achieving those goals. Thanks to U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation 
system that measures recipient countries' progress. For the first time, 
donors can link a portion of their contributions to IDA to the 
achievement of actual development results, and part of the U.S. 
contribution is linked in this way. We will strive to make sure that the 
World Bank and other multilateral development banks build on this 
progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything 
that these institutions do.

*	Increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in 
the form of grants instead of loans. Greater use of results-based grants 
is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, 
particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with 
ever-larger debt burdens. As a result of U.S. leadership, the recent IDA 
agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the 
poorest countries for education, HIV/AIDS, health, nutrition, water, 
sanitation, and other human needs. Our goal is to build on that progress 
by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development 
banks. We will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private 
sector to match government efforts by using grants to support 
development projects that show results.

*	Open societies to commerce and investment. Trade and investment are 
the real engines of economic growth. Even if government aid increases, 
most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and 
foreign investment. An effective strategy must try to expand these flows 
as well. Free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national 
security strategy.

*	Secure public health. The scale of the public health crisis in poor 
countries is enormous. In countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics 
like HIV/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be 
threatened until these scourges can be contained. Resources from the 
developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest 
governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective 
local infrastructure. The United States has strongly backed the new 
global fund for HIV/AIDS organized by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan 
and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for 
treatment and care. The United States already contributes more than 
twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. If the 
global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.

*	Emphasize education. Literacy and learning are the foundation of 
democracy and development. Only about 7 percent of World Bank resources 
are devoted to education. This proportion should grow. The United States 
will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 
percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher 
training in Africa. The United States can also bring information 
technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been 
devastated by AIDS.

*	Continue to aid agricultural development. New technologies, 
including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields 
in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. 
Using sound science, the United States should help bring these benefits 
to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still 
suffer from hunger and malnutrition.


VIII. Develop Agendas for Cooperative Action with the Other Main Centers 
of Global Power


""We have our best chance since the rise of the nation-state in the 17th 
century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead 
of prepare for war.""





President Bush
West Point, New York
June 1, 2002



America will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions -- as 
broad as practicable -- of states able and willing to promote a balance 
of power that favors freedom. Effective coalition leadership requires 
clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent 
consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.

There is little of lasting consequence that the United States can 
accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies 
and friends in Canada and Europe. Europe is also the seat of two of the 
strongest and most able international institutions in the world: the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), which has, since its 
inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and inter-European 
security, and the European Union (EU), our partner in opening world 
trade.

The attacks of September 11 were also an attack on NATO, as NATO itself 
recognized when it invoked its Article V self-defense clause for the 
first time. NATO's core mission -- collective defense of the 
transatlantic alliance of democracies -- remains, but NATO must develop 
new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new 
circumstances. NATO must build a capability to field, at short notice, 
highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to 
respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.

The alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, 
creating coalitions under NATO's own mandate, as well as contributing to 
mission-based coalitions. To achieve this, we must:

*	expand NATO's membership to those democratic nations willing and 
able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests;

*	ensure that the military forces of NATO nations have appropriate 
combat contributions to make in coalition warfare;

*	develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become 
effective multinational fighting forces;

*	take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of 
scale in our defense spending to transform NATO military forces so that 
they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities;

*	streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to 
meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of 
training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations; 
and

*	maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as 
we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.


If NATO succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a 
partnership as central to the security and interests of its member 
states as was the case during the Cold War. We will sustain a common 
perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to 
take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. At the 
same time, we welcome our European allies' efforts to forge a greater 
foreign policy and defense identity with the EU, and commit ourselves to 
close consultations to ensure that these developments work with NATO. We 
cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of 
transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.

The attacks of September 11 energized America's Asian alliances. 
Australia invoked the ANZUS Treaty to declare the September 11 was an 
attack on Australia itself, following that historic decision with the 
dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for Operation 
Enduring Freedom. Japan and the Republic of Korea provided unprecedented 
levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist 
attack. We have deepened cooperation on counter-terrorism with our 
alliance partners in Thailand and the Philippines and received 
invaluable assistance from close friends like Singapore and New Zealand.

The war against terrorism has proven that America's alliances in Asia 
not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and 
ready to deal with new challenges. To enhance our Asian alliances and 
friendships, we will:


*	look to Japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and 
global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our 
close defense and diplomatic cooperation;

*	work with South Korea to maintain vigilance towards the North while 
preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of 
the region over the longer-term;

*	build on 50 years of U.S.-Australian alliance cooperation as we 
continue working together to resolve regional and global problems -- as 
we have so many times from the Battle of Leyte Gulf to Tora Bora;

*	maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our 
allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic 
environment; and

*	build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with 
institutions such as ASEAN and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation 
forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage 
change in this dynamic region.


We are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power 
competition. Several potential great powers are now in the midst of 
internal transition -- most importantly Russia, India, and China. In all 
three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly 
global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.

With Russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based 
on a central reality of the twenty-first century: the United States and 
Russia are no longer strategic adversaries. The Moscow Treaty on 
Strategic Reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a 
critical change in Russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, 
long-term relations with the Euro-Atlantic community and the United 
States. Russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their 
country's current weakness and the policies -- internal and external -- 
needed to reverse those weaknesses. They understand, increasingly, that 
Cold War approaches do not serve their national interests and that 
Russian and American strategic interests overlap in many areas.

United States policy seeks to use this turn in Russian thinking to 
refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and 
challenges. We are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the 
global war on terrorism. We are facilitating Russia's entry into the 
World Trade Organization, without lowering standards for accession, to 
promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. We have 
created the NATO-Russia Council with the goal of deepening security 
cooperation among Russia, our European allies, and ourselves. We will 
continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the 
former Soviet Union in the belief that a prosperous and stable 
neighborhood will reinforce Russia's growing commitment to integration 
into the Euro-Atlantic community.

At the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still 
divide us from Russia and about the time and effort it will take to 
build an enduring strategic partnership. Lingering distrust of our 
motives and policies by key Russian elites slows improvement in our 
relations. Russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of free-market 
democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons 
of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. Russia's very 
weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. Nevertheless, those 
opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years -- or even 
decades.

The United States has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral 
relationship with India based on a conviction that U.S. interests 
require a strong relationship with India. We are the two largest 
democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative 
government. India is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. We 
have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through 
the vital sea lanes of the Indian Ocean. Finally, we share an interest 
in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable Asia.

Differences remain, including over the development of India's nuclear 
and missile programs, and the pace of India's economic reforms. But 
while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about 
India, today we start with a view of India as a growing world power with 
which we have common strategic interests. Through a strong partnership 
with India, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic 
future.

The United States relationship with China is an important part of our 
strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous Asia-Pacific 
region. We welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous 
China. The democratic development of China is crucial to that future. 
Yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst 
features of the Communist legacy, China's leaders have not yet made the 
next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. 
In pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its 
neighbors in the Asia-Pacific region, China is following an outdated 
path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national 
greatness. In time, China will find that social and political freedom is 
the only source of that greatness.

The United States seeks a constructive relationship with a changing 
China. We already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including 
the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the Korean 
peninsula. Likewise, we have coordinated on the future of Afghanistan 
and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counter-terrorism and 
similar transitional concerns. Shared health and environmental threats, 
such as the spread of HIV/AIDS, challenge us to promote jointly the 
welfare of our citizens.

Addressing these transnational threats will challenge China to become 
more open with information, promote the development of civil society, 
and enhance individual human rights. China has begun to take the road to 
political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting 
village-level elections, yet remains strongly committed to national 
one-party rule by the Communist Party. To make that nation truly 
accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work 
remains to be done. Only by allowing the Chinese people to think, 
assemble, and worship freely can China reach its full potential.

Our important trade relationship will benefit from China's entry into 
the World Trade Organization, which will create more export 
opportunities and ultimately more jobs for American farmers, workers, 
and companies. China is our fourth largest trading partner, with over 
$100 billion in annual two-way trade. The power of market principles and 
the WTO's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance 
openness and the rule of law in China to help establish basic 
protections for commerce and for citizens. There are, however, other 
areas in which we have profound disagreements. Our commitment to the 
self-defense of Taiwan under the Taiwan Relations Act is one. Human 
rights is another. We expect China to adhere to its nonproliferation 
commitments. We will work to narrow differences where they exist, but 
not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.

The events of September 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for 
relations between the United States and other main centers of global 
power, and opened vast, new opportunities. With our long-standing allies 
in Europe and Asia, and with leaders in Russia, India, and China, we 
must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships 
become routine and unproductive.

Every agency of the United States Government shares the challenge. We 
can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober 
analysis, and common action. In the long-term, these are the practices 
that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open 
the path of progress.

IX. Transform America's National Security Institutions to Meet the 
Challenges and Opportunities of the Twenty-First Century


""Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch 
its source. America is successful because of the hard work, creativity, 
and enterprise of our people.""





President Bush
Washington, D.C. (Joint Session of Congress)
September 20, 2001



The major institutions of American national security were designed in a 
different era to meet different requirements. All of them must be 
transformed.

It is time to reaffirm the essential role of American military strength. 
We must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. Our military's 
highest priority is to defend the United States. To do so effectively, 
our military must:

*	assure our allies and friends;

*	dissuade future military competition;

*	deter threats against U.S. interests, allies, and friends; and

*	decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.


The unparalleled strength of the United States armed forces, and their 
forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most 
strategically vital regions. However, the threats and enemies we must 
confront have changed, and so must our forces. A military structured to 
deter massive Cold War-era armies must be transformed to focus more on 
how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might 
occur. We will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational 
challenges.

The presence of American forces overseas is one of the most profound 
symbols of the U.S. commitments to allies and friends. Through our 
willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, 
the United States demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of 
power that favors freedom. To contend with uncertainty and to meet the 
many security challenges we face, the United States will require bases 
and stations within and beyond Western Europe and Northeast Asia, as 
well as temporary access arrangements for the long-distance deployment 
of U.S. forces.

Before the war in Afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major 
planning contingencies. Yet, in a very short time, we had to operate 
across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch 
of the armed forces. We must prepare for more such deployments by 
developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, long-range precision 
strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. 
This broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the 
ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure 
U.S. access to distant theaters, and protect critical U.S. 
infrastructure and assets in outer space.

Innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new 
approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting U.S. 
intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and 
technology. We must also transform the way the Department of Defense is 
run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. 
Finally, while maintaining near-term readiness and the ability to fight 
the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the President with a 
wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of 
coercion against the United States, our allies, and our friends.

We know from history that deterrence can fail; and we know from 
experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. The United States must 
and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy -- 
whether a state or non-state actor -- to impose its will on the United 
States, our allies, or our friends. We will maintain the forces 
sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. Our forces 
will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a 
military build-up in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the 
United States.

Intelligence -- and how we use it -- is our first line of defense 
against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. Designed 
around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, 
fixed object -- the Soviet bloc -- the intelligence community is coping 
with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of 
targets.

We must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to 
keep pace with the nature of these threats. Intelligence must be 
appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems 
and coordinated with our allies and friends. We need to protect the 
capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the 
knowledge of how best to surprise us. Those who would harm us also seek 
the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and 
to maximize injury.

We must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide 
integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. Since 
the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted 
inside the United States, we must also ensure the proper fusion of 
information between intelligence and law enforcement.

Initiatives in this area will include:

*	strengthening the authority of the Director of Central Intelligence 
to lead the development and actions of the Nation's foreign intelligence 
capabilities;

*	establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides 
seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing 
the nation and our allies;

*	continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to 
sustain our intelligence advantage;

*	investing in future capabilities while working to protect them 
through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence 
capabilities; and

*	collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the 
government with all-source analysis.


As the United States Government relies on the armed forces to defend 
America's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other 
nations. We will ensure that the Department of State receives funding 
sufficient to ensure the success of American diplomacy. The State 
Department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with 
other governments. And in this new era, its people and institutions must 
be able to interact equally adroitly with non-governmental organizations 
and international institutions. Officials trained mainly in 
international politics must also extend their reach to understand 
complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public 
health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.

Our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil 
wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. As humanitarian relief 
requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build 
police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial 
government institutions, and electoral systems. Effective international 
cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by American 
readiness to play our part.

Just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out 
to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to 
public information efforts that can help people around the world learn 
about and understand America. The war on terrorism is not a clash of 
civilizations. It does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, 
a battle for the future of the Muslim world. This is a struggle of ideas 
and this is an area where America must excel.

We will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet 
our global security commitments and protect Americans are not impaired 
by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the 
International Criminal Court (ICC), whose jurisdiction does not extend 
to Americans and which we do not accept. We will work together with 
other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and 
cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral 
agreements that will protect U.S. nationals from the ICC. We will 
implement fully the American Servicemembers Protection Act, whose 
provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of U.S. 
personnel and officials.

We will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the 
right level and allocation of government spending on national security. 
The United States Government must strengthen its defenses to win this 
war. At home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for 
the American people.

Today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is 
diminishing. In a globalized world, events beyond America's borders have 
a greater impact inside them. Our society must be open to people, ideas, 
and goods from across the globe. The characteristics we most cherish -- 
our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life -- are 
vulnerable to terrorism. This vulnerability will persist long after we 
bring to justice those responsible for the September eleventh attacks. 
As time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that 
until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. This 
is a new condition of life. We will adjust to it and thrive -- in spite 
of it.

In exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and 
interests of our friends and partners. Still, we will be prepared to act 
apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. When we 
disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for 
our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. We will not allow

Ultimately, the foundation of American strength is at home. It is in the

-driver.spec tweak for homemade kernels,"This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

--Boundary_(ID_KtnWPrcWHTTzQa7OHxPjiA)
Content-type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed
Content-transfer-encoding: 7BIT

I use a mostly Red Hat 8.0 system, but prefer to configure and build my 
kernel by hand.  I'd like to humbly offer a tweak to alsa-driver.spec 
that helps it build cleanly under such circumstances.  I recognize that 
freshrpms.net packages are designed with standard Red Hat in mind, 
including a standard kernel RPM.  However, I hope that Matthias will 
consider the tweak small enough to justify its incorporation.

The diff is attached below.  The first part of the diff contains a 
conditional that checks to see if the expected RPM is installed.  If it 
is, %{karch} is set as before and a new %{krpm} flag is set to 1.  If 
the expected RPM is not installed, then %{karch} is instead set using 
""uname -p"", while %{krpm} is left undefined.

The second part of the diff is simpler.  We only require that 
kernel-source be installed if the kernel itself came from an RPM.  (If 
the kernel was hand-built, the presumably the user knows enough to have 
retained the sources in the expected place.)

Again, I realize that I'm operating ""off warrantee"" by not using a Red 
Hat kernel RPM.  Matthias, if you think this tweak is reasonable and not 
too ugly, I'd love to see you pick it up.  If not, well at least this 
message will sit in the archives and may help other folks in the future.

Nope, this is ""normal"" as Red Hat removed all mp3 support from 8.0 because
of patent and royalty issues :-(
On freshrpms.net, you can find the xmms mp3 plugin as I said, but also
libmad, lame (mp3 encoder), and soon mpg321 as I often used it myself.
Many other players can also play mp3 files, like alsaplayer, xine, mplayer.

The ""--define"" is exactly what I was looking for! I was trying to
figure out a way to do it within the mechanism of rpm (like the
""--with"" switches), but for some reason didn't think of using
""--define"". My computer is currently gone for repairs, but once it's
back, I'll rewrite the specfile, add support for kernel-smp, and email
it to the list for further criticism :)

As far as requiring kernel-source, I don't feel it's a big problem. If
you're gonna go to the trouble of packaging custom kernels into rpms,
it's not a far stretch to package the source tree too (as I currently
do).

Also, I've found that the alsa-driver source needs a usb-related patch 
to compile under the latest test kernels (2.4.20-preX). Are other 
people seeing the same thing, or is this just a problem with my setup?

gary

P.S. If I didn't mention it before, thanks for the alsa packages! They 
greatly simplified what used to take way too long before.

OK - I've yet to dive into the latest round of changes, but I plan to.
I can say I'll make any progress, but I may dabble.  Thanks again for

Perl doesn't complain that it can't find PerMsgStatus.pm but the function 
check_for_content_type_just_html(). Do you probably have some old rules 
files still lurking around? This test existed in 2.31 but is gone/was

Planning battle tactics; for this reason, the intelligence press
reports, spy satellites have had 1-meter resolution for many years.

Finding an individual vehicle in a city might occasionally be possible
with 1-m images and might occasionally also be worth the money.

For small areas you have legitimate access to, it's probably cheaper
to go there with a digital camera and a GPS and take some snapshots
from ground level.  Aerial photos might be cheaper for large areas,
areas where you're not allowed --- or, perhaps, physically able --- to
go, and cases where you don't have time to send a ground guy around
the whole area.

Ran across a site which claimed to explain the original meaning of the
Ten Commandments.  It seems some of those meanings have evolved a bit,
too.

In particular, there was a claim that the commandment on stealing was
actually specifically about 'man stealing -- selling a free man into
slavery.  Certainly the US southerners were particularly sensitive to
the term 'man stealer' in a way I didn't understand.

Yep, I know he said all holy books.  No, I don't know if this site was

""x"" is fine, but let's not take out the config option.  if people really
want to have it be something else, we shouldn't hinder them.

[ILUG] Modem question,"Quoting Breathnach, Proinnsias (Dublin) (breatpro@exchange.ie.ml.com):

Do a wget of a file of known length, in a script that runs ""date"" before
and after (or equivalent).

Be aware that speed between you and your upstream link is one thing;
speed through countless congested routers to a faraway location may be
quite another.  Remember that hardware-level compression is a factor.
(The file you wget will probably be precompressed.)

In the area of the slightly more exotic, be aware that different traffic
may have higher priority and thus more available bandwidth at various
points in the transit to/from you -- and that some traffic may go via 
different paths coming vs. going.

Be aware that raw bulk transfer speed may not be the only thing that
matters:  Depending on what you're doing, the modem's connection latency
might matter, and this differs widely between modems.  (It matters more
for interactive sessions, e.g., ssh remote logins, where each keystroke
is echoed from remote.)

I actually like Neale's X-Spam-Disposition header, I just wonder if maybe we

Also, some sort of version information would be useful.  Perhaps the CVS

The Curse of India's Socialism,"I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.

Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).

Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.

So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail?  ""Insecure dependency"" screams ""I'm in taint mode!"", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).

If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put ""DROPPRIVS=yes""
in the procmailrc. :)

 an engineer flaps his wings,"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/03.html#when_an_engineer_flaps_his_wings
Date: 2002-10-03T01:31:51-05:00

Remember that saying from chaos theory about how when a butterfly flap its 
wings, it can cause a hurricane a month later halfway around the world? As 
several people have already noted, Google has made some major changes in their 
most recent update. The weblogging community was hit hard (for instance, I used 
to be the #1 ""mark""[1]; I am now #6). The changes appear to be the result of an 
attempt to stop two phenomena: explicitly selling ads based on PageRank[2], and 
Google bombing[3]. 

Specifically, Google is now apparently cross-checking link text with the linked 
site, and discounting or ignoring links whose text does not appear in the 
linked site. This all but kills off Google bombing. Searching for ""go to hell""
[4] no longer takes you to microsoft.com[5]; searching for ""talentless hack""[6] 
no longer finds ohmessylife.com[7], although it finds a lot of people who were 
previously participating in the Google bombing. No definitive word yet on 
whether Google is actively penalizing such sites. 

Unfortunately, the algorithm tweaks necessary to stop these two techniques have 
caused a wide range of collateral damage, apparently coming down hardest on 
medium-to-large sites that had previously been doing everything right (as far 
as page structure, link structure, accessibility, and general honest hard work 
putting together a usable and useful site). The Webmasterworld forums are alive 
with complaints and speculation: 

- New update, pagerank death?[8] 
- September 2002 Google Update Discussion - part 1[9] 
- Let's find out what happened - Sept 2002 Update - pt. 2[10] 

(Side note: amongst the confusion, it has been suggested that Google is no 
longer indexing ALT text in images. I can confirm that this is absolutely 
false. Searching diveintomark.org for ""gimli""[11] finds my entry of July 29[12]
, where ""Gimli"" is mentioned only in the ALT text of an image.) 

Regardless, Google's search results in general appear to be significantly 
degraded in many key areas. The forums are full of people complaining that spam 
sites, doorway pages, and obvious cloaking attempts, which Google used to be so 
good at filtering out, are now popping up in top spots with disturbing 
frequency. Nobody in the forums wants to talk about which keywords they're 
tracking, so I tried to find my own concrete example of crap search results. It 
didn't take long. 

- Searching for reservation hotel[13] brings up an empty sub-page[14] of a 
hotel reservation company in Italy[15] as the first result. This seems 
unhelpful, and unlikely to be relevant to the average US-based consumer (and 
Google absolutely knows I'm in the US based on my IP address). 
- Searching for news observer nc[16] (the News & Observer is a Raleigh, NC 
newspaper) does find The News & Observer[17], but it also finds an Internet 
betting spam page[18] at #7 and a non-existent page[19] at #9. 
- Searching for eminem[20] gives us two generic portal pages, a non-existent 
site, and a site that redirects to a site that continuously redirects to itself 
(I am not making this up). And this is just on the first page. Good thing I 
didn't care that much about Eminem to begin with, because Google just isn't 
that helpful. 

Many people in the Webmasterworld forums are now suggesting that AllTheWeb.com
[21] has better search results overall. Just as a single comparison, their 
results for ""eminem""[22] do appear to be much more relevant. Is this the 
beginning of the end of Google's reign?

"ARRRGHHH Had GPG working, now it doesnt.","2 things - first, the switch parser changed in a subtle way with 8.4 -
byte-code compilation was added, and it is slightly more strict in
its parsing than the original parser.  You can only have a comment where
Tcl would expect to find a command.  Switch has a ""pattern - body""
strucutre, so if you goof and put a comment where it is trying to find
a pattern, both of you will be confused with the results.  The
subtlty arises with extra whitespace and newlines. I can't give you
the exact case, but I know exmh had one example that stopped parsing
correctly, and was arguably wrong before.

2nd - I've managed to remain fairly ignoranat of the PGP support in
exmh, so you'll have to dig in yourself or see if someone else on
exmh-users or exmh-workers is having similar problems.

:-).

Seriously. Look at he life expectancy and human carrying capacity of
this continent before the Europeans got here. Look at it now. Even
for descendants of the original inhabitants. Even for the descendents
of slaves, who were brought here by force.

More stuff, cheaper. That's progress.

Poverty, of course, is not relative. It's absolute. Disparity in
wealth has nothing to do with it.

It's like saying that groups have rights, when, in truth, only
individuals do. Like group rights, ""disparity"" in wealth is
statistical sophistry.


Besides, even if you can't help the distribution, industrial wealth
is almost always transitory, and so is relative poverty, even when
there are no confiscatory death-taxes. The 20th anniversary Forbes
400 just came out, and only a few tens of people are still there
since 1982, a time which had significantly higher marginal taxes on
wealth, income, and inheritance than we do now. More to the point,
they're nowhere near the top.

I'll take those odds. It is only when neofeudalism reasserts itself,
in the form of government regulation, confiscatory taxes, legislated
monopoly, corporate welfare, ""non-profit"" neoaristocratic tax dodges,
and legalized labor extortion that we get slowdowns in progress, like
what happened in Fabian-era Britain, or 1970's USA.

In fact, it is in countries where wealth is the most ""unfairly""
distributed, that you get the most improvement in the general --
economic -- welfare. More stuff cheaper, fewer people dying, more
people living longer.

I'll take those odds as well. People take greater risks when the
returns are higher, improving the lot of us all as a result.

RAH

OK, here's a refinement.  Assuming very little spam comes through, we
only need to pick a small percentage of ham received as new training
ham to match the new training spam.  The program could randomly select
a sufficient number of saved non-spam msgs and ask the user to
validate this selection.  You could do this once a day or week (config
parameter).

I'm trying to think about the end-user issues because I have nothing

ey City Lexicon,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85506002
Date: Not supplied

After the talk at UT Austin, I spent Saturday at the Turkey City science 
fiction writers' workshop at Bruce Sterling's place. Turkey City is a venerable 
science fiction workshop that has spawned many good writers and a lexicon of 
science fiction critical terms that is the de facto standard for understanding 
what works and what doesn't in a work of science fiction: 

    Squid on the Mantelpiece 

    Chekhov said that if there are dueling pistols over the mantelpiece in the 
    first act, they should be fired in the third. In other words, a plot 
    element should be deployed in a timely fashion and with proper dramatic 
    emphasis. However, in SF plotting the MacGuffins are often so overwhelming 
    that they cause conventional plot structures to collapse. It's hard to 
    properly dramatize, say, the domestic effects of Dad's bank overdraft when 
    a giant writhing kraken is levelling the city. This mismatch between the 
    conventional dramatic proprieties and SF's extreme, grotesque, or visionary 
    thematics is known as the ""squid on the mantelpiece."" 

    Card Tricks in the Dark 

    Elaborately contrived plot which arrives at (a) the punchline of a private 
    joke no reader will get or (b) the display of some bit of learned trivia 
    relevant only to the author. This stunt may be intensely ingenious, and 
    very gratifying to the author, but it serves no visible fictional purpose.

zteana] Compensation for World's youngest mother,"http://www.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/americas/08/26/peru.mother.reut/index.html

LIMA, Peru (Reuters) -- Lina Medina's parents thought their 5-year-old daughter had a huge abdominal tumor and when shamans in their remote village in Peru's Andes could find no cure, her father carried her to hospital. 

Just over a month later, she gave birth to a boy. 

Aged 5 years, seven months and 21 days old when her child was born by Caesarean section in May 1939, Medina made medical history, and is still the youngest known mother in the world. 

At the time, Peru's government promised aid that never materialized. Six decades on, Medina lives with her husband in a cramped house in a poor, crime-ridden district of the Peruvian capital known as ""Little Chicago."" 

Now 68, she keeps herself to herself and has long refused requests to rake up the past. Gerardo, the son she delivered while still a child herself, died in 1979 at the age of 40. 

But a new book, written by an obstetrician who has been interested in her case, has drawn fresh attention to Medina's story, and raised the prospect that the Peruvian government may belatedly offer her financial and other assistance. 

""The government condemned them to live in poverty. In any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" Jose Sandoval, author of ""Mother Aged 5,"" told Reuters. 

""We still have time to repair the damage done to her. That's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 

'Totally willing to help'
Sandoval has raised Medina's case with the office of first lady Eliane Karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension -- something officials say is possible. 

""We're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman Marta Castaneda. But Suni Ramos, of the social action department of Karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning -- such as kitchen and other household equipment -- it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. It is currently trying to contact Medina and her family. 

Medina's husband, Raul Jurado, told Reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""She got no help (in 1939) that I know about,"" he said. ""She thinks governments never deliver. Maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" 

Jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, had turned down Reuters' request for an interview. 

Medical rarity
No one has ever established who was the father of Medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. 

One of nine children born to country folk in Ticrapo, an Andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in Peru's poorest province, Medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, Sandoval said. 

He said she had her first period at 2 1/2, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the Caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. 

Her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""They thought it was a tumor,"" he said. But shamans ruled out village superstitions -- including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them -- and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, Pisco. 

There came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. 

Her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest -- he was later released for lack of evidence -- and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. 

Sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as Medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mother-to-be drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a U.S. businessman, which was turned down. 

More offers followed after Medina was transferred to a Lima hospital, where her fully developed 6-pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on May 14, 1939 -- Mother's Day. 

One offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for Medina and her baby to be exhibited at the World's Fair in New York. Another, from a U.S. business that the family accepted in early June 1939, was for the pair to travel to the United States for scientists to study the case. The offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. 

But within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that Medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. 

But Sandoval said: ""It abandoned the case after six months ...It did absolutely nothing for them."" 

Happy ending?
Though physically mature, Medina -- who Sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms -- still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. 

Medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a Supreme Court ruling allowing her to live with them again. 

After taunting from schoolmates, Gerardo -- who was named after one of the doctors who attended Medina and became their mentor -- discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. 

He died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but Sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. 

Medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. Her second child now lives in Mexico. 

She appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""We just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said Jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. 

He said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to Medina and which the then-government expropriated more than two decades ago. That house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. 

He said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own -- they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. 

""If the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. 

As for Sandoval, he said he was optimistic that Medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""I believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said. 

""As a result of the war, corporations have now been enthroned and an era
of corruption in high places will follow and the money-power of the
country will endeavor to prolong its reign by working upon the
prejudices of the people until the wealth is aggregated in a few hands
and the Republic is destroyed.""
Abraham Lincoln (Nov 21, 1864 in a letter to Col. William F Elkins)

ALSA (almost) made easy,"Thanks Matthias.  Actually I got all four speakers with subwoofer

which is in analog mode.  But digital out works great now!

Hm. One could do this with rpm's --justdb switch too, without having to 
make a dummy package, right?

I was wondering that this is a bit dangerous if there is a update for my 
software, as the dummy package might get updated with it overwriting the 
installation I've done from source... Not good.

Is there really no ""--nodeps"" kind of switch in apt-get?

They were the ruling class of a feudal, farming society for quite some
time; I believe there were more than a few issues there. Certainly, not
everyone in Tibet is as excited about the Dalai Lama as Hollywood
appears to be. [Not that the Chinese are much better rights-wise, but
they've actually built roads and such, which led to the creation of
merchant classes and the like that never existed under the Tibetans.]

As a new user of SA, I guess I'm having trouble connecting the dots.  If 
I understand you:  If I don't use the ""nomime"" => 1 option and I recieve 
MIME mail, the Mail::Internet modules become unavailable.

Unavailable for which?  MA?  SA?  What do these methods do?  Does this 
mean my incoming MIME mail won't be checked by SA unless I specify

ility Problems with Mozilla,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85409355
Date: Not supplied

Blake blogs[1] about how mpt[2] wants Mozilla to look just like MSIE. I have to 
admit, the evidence is pretty compelling. I recall someone asking me, ""Do you 
really agree with mpt's Top 10 list? He's quoted you at the top of the list!""

Do I agree that those ten items mpt mentions are the top ten problems? Of 
course not. No two people will have the same top ten problems. Also keep in 
mind that mpt and I can agree that something is a problem without necessarily 
agreeing on the solution to the problem. Maybe we have different ideas 
regarding how to solve a particular issue, but we at least both believe it is 
an issue that needs to be addressed. That's something.

To cover the list specifically:


- Navigator chrome structure - While I don't necessarily agree with mpt's 
proposed default configuration, I do agree that the chrome structure is 
painfully restrictive, and that customizable toolbars need to be implemented in 
order for us to acquire the flexibility to deal with this problem.

- Speed - can't argue with this, except to say that cutting out a lot of the 
useless UI and features from the chrome helps substantially. Reduce bloat, gain 
speed.

- Text editing - if you use Chimera on the Mac, you'll see that the textfield 
widget is easily the most painful part of the entire application. It's buggy, 
slow, misbehaves, and doesn't edit the way you'd expect. This is IMO Chimera's 
top usability problem.

- Message display - Yes. No argument here.

- Search - Yeah, it's a mess. Don't know if it would be in my top ten, but it's 
a mess.

- Menu structure - This gets back to my blog about how the apps should be 
separated. The menu structure has been complicated in order to deal with 
multiple applications. A clean separation naturally simplifies the menus (e.g., 
you can eliminate the New submenu easily).

- Migration - A problem, but IMO not one of the top ten facing Mozilla.

- Context menus - mpt complains about two-click context menus, and yet, the OS 
default on Win32 (overwhelmingly) is to bring up a context menu on a mouse up. 
If you don't like it, complain about Win32, but don't cite this as a Mozilla 
usability problem when we're following the conventions of the operating system. 
(We simply listen for the WM_CONTEXTMENU message. That message fires when Win32 
wants to fire it.)

- Validation - Err, no. Not a usability problem. To the average bear, this is 
completely irrelevant.

- Preferences - IMO this should be much higher on the list. Preferences are a 
tangled pathetic mess. Again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique 
dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly 
half the preferences that exist from the GUI. Mozilla is ridiculously 
overconfigurable.

The President's niece will no longer have to forge prescriptions for Valium. 
All she'll have to do is participate in an unruly public demonstration to get a 
free dose. Unfortunately for her, the government has no plans to shoot rocks of 
cocaine at demonstrators, so she'll still have to depend on her drug dealer for 
that. 

    The U.S. military is exploring ways to use drugs such as Valium to calm 
    people without killing them during riots or other crowd control situations 
    where lethal weapons are inappropriate.

Yes, them too.  When wolves attack their sheep, they coral the wolf

Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
By Andrew Marshall

BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.

""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
knew then there was something special.""

Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
-- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
who is expecting their first child.

Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
in search of a wife.

""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""

Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
the couple married.

MR. MARRIAGE

Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
agency.

Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.

""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
knowledge, they have all been successful.""

Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.

Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
language problems.

""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""

After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
client has found a potential wife.

""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
usually within the next year.

Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
than 10 percent have broken up.

Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.

""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
down, OK, we'll talk.""'

But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
stress disorder.

WHY?

Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.

But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
need Wan,"" he said.

""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
their future husband.""

Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
choose to use his agency.

His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
not ""God's gift to women.""

Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.

""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
Impossible,"" she said.

""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ladies from other countries.""

Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
not a major obstacle.

""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
very quickly.""

Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
to the West.

""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
how to eat, and when to make tea.""

PITFALLS

But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
back in Bangkok, sad and angry.

""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
spoke to me.""

Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""

Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
unsuitable candidates are weeded out.

""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
comers.""

Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
looking for a foreign husband.

""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""

""I groove all that stuff about how platforms need to be cheap and ubiquitous,

both 1) to maintain a perception of value in the platform, and 2) to create 
significant margins well before ubiquity is assured so that the ecosystem is 
assured of the platform's ultimate viability."" What he doesn't mention: if you 
lower the price on the only product you're selling, you have a revenue hit, 
which will not make your investors happy, and you may run out of money and have 
to close. But that must be what he's thinking.

When I'd read that ""getting legal title
can take 20 years"", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.

If I see people living in shanties and
haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
their parcels weren't exactly recorded
on the government maps, or paid for with
a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
intent on keeping them ""development"" free.

Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view
of America"" to say that outside of Metro
Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
is the boondocks.  But going on that very
broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.

So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.

The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to ""introduce market mechanisms"".  It is
left as an exercise to come up with one
which works when many of the agents (are
perceived to) have negligible NPV.

Yes ;)

first off, redhat does not support upgrading from beta's to the released 
version.  That doesn't mean it can't work, it means nobody tried it, they 
sure didn't test it or fix anything to make it work, and you're on your 
own.

second, historically a new .0 numbers mostly means ""so much has been 
changed that you might have problems upgrading from any previous release 
anyway"".  So, historically, most users installing a .0 release do this 
from scratch anyway, doing upgrades throughout x.0->x.y.

- _Shelley Powers_: The RDF Query-O-Matic[2], and The RDF Query-O-Matic 
explained[3]. &#8220;The Query-o-Matic accepts the name of an RDF file (any 
valid RDF file), and an RDFQL (RDF Query Language) query, and will print out a 
test value found as a result of that query.&#8221; 
- _Marcus Campbell_: &#8220;My FOAF autocreation script is moving along nicely
[4]. It's now looping through my OPML blogroll file, checking the first load of 
bites in people's pages for head linked FOAF files, grabbing certain elements 
from these files (if they have one) and spitting them out into a brand new FOAF 
file for me.&#8221; 
- _Joe Gregorio_: The Well-Formed Web[5]. &#8220;After spending some time 
badgering poor Bill Kearney for a concrete benefit of having RDF in RSS 1.0 and 
not getting a really satisfactory answer I went back and read Paul Ford's essay 
again. I wanted to get that old religious feeling back again. It didn't work. 
The magic was gone.&#8221;

epreneurs,"An apparent quote from Dubya, from the Times (sent to me by my Dad):

http://www.timesonline.co.uk/printFriendly/0,,1-43-351083,00.html

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TONY BLAIR's special relationship with George W. Bush is under
considerable strain. Not only do the two disagree on Yassir Arafat's
tenure as leader of the Palestinian Authority, but Blair has started
telling disparaging anecdotes about the President.

Baroness Williams of Crosby recalled a story told to her by 'my good
friend Tony Blair' recently in Brighton. Blair, Bush and Jacques
Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular, the decline of
the French economy. 'The problem with the French,' Bush confided in
Blair, 'is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.'

Agreed, especially since my packages are primarily meant for the original

probably not going to recompile ALSA with *all* the drivers anyway ;-)

ian Updates] Hyperlink handling in Gaim allows arbitrary code to be executed,"Severity: Security
Product: gaim
Keywords: gaim hyperlink manual
References: 
  CAN-2002-0989 
    http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CAN-2002-0989
  Gaim Changelog
    http://gaim.sourceforge.net/ChangeLog

Gaim is an instant messaging client based on the published TOC
protocol from AOL. The developers of Gaim, an instant messenger client
that combines several different networks, found a vulnerability in the
hyperlink handling code. The 'Manual' browser command passes an
untrusted string to the shell without escaping or reliable quoting,
permitting an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the users
machine. Unfortunately, Gaim doesn't display the hyperlink before the
user clicks on it. Users who use other inbuilt browser commands aren't
vulnerable.

The fixed version of Gaim no longer passes the user's manual browser
command to the shell. Commands which contain the %s in quotes will
need to be amended, so they don't contain any quotes. The 'Manual'
browser command can be edited in the 'General' pane of the
'Preferences' dialog, which can be accessed by clicking 'Options' from
the login window, or 'Tools' and then 'Preferences' from the menu bar
in the buddy list window.

Please download Gaim 0.59.1 or later using Red Carpet. You may also
obtain this update from the Ximian FTP site.

         For those of us who can't read the abbreviation EULA without 
         thinking of Martian fighting machines and their ""deafening 
         howls... which roared like thunder"", we're sorry to report 
         that this weekend's multimedia performance of Jeff Wayne's WAR 
         OF THE WORLDS has been postponed due to ""health and safety 
         issues"". The event was to feature computer graphics, 
         fireworks, ""60ft-tall Martian fighting machines"" wreaking 
         ""havoc and destruction"", and - most terrifyingly of all - the 
         possibility of a David Essex tribute singer performing with 
         Hawkwind, but UKP18 tickets for the Sat 2002-08-31 show at 
         Manchester's Heaton Park will still be valid at a range of new 
         venues next summer. Ironically, the Martians' original 
         invasion plans were similarly thwarted by health and safety 
         issues, ""slain after all man's devices had failed by the 
         humblest creatures that God, in his wisdom, has put upon this 
         earth: bacteria. Minute, invisible, bacteria. For, directly 
         the invaders arrived and drank and fed, our microscopic allies 
         attacked them...""

For a long time I have used an external editor with exmh (gvim).

I can cut'n'paste from exmh's message display window into spawned
gvim processes, but not into anything else.

This is VERY annoying.

  (I have to look at the message with cat or less or whatever in a
  terminal window if I want to do this - which is quite often.  And
  if the message is q-p encoded or a non-text/plain mime type, I end
  up with all that raw garbage too).

Anyway to fix this?

(BTW: standard i386 redhat7.3)

Thanks.

   hit a second + and you go to ""set a target"" mode.  Type a few

I should have finished this off.

or-users] Reducing impact from tons of email,"I'm not sure if this is really a razor problem/issue or a sendmail
problem. Here's the scenario... My mail server is a 150mhz PC funning
FreeBSD 4.4. Ordinarily, the machine is quite idle; it supports my
wife's web site with Apache server running on it and a few other
services (jabber, etc). Between the various members of our family, we
get a fair amount of email coming in (mailing lists, etc). On
occasion, our DSL-based ISP dies for a number of hours. When we get a
reconnection to the Internet, I get a huge flow of emails coming in
which are then filtered via razor. As a result, I will sometimes see
over 20+ sendmail processes running at the same time after such an
occasion. The machine is then REALLY slow.

I noticed that my /etc/procmailrc file had had no arguments associated
with the call to razor-check. There was something in the log, though,
to make me suspicious that it was possibly not seeing all my razor
files. So I have just added ""-home /etc/razor"" as an argument. I
haven't had any down time since then so I cannot comment on whether
this change has sped up my razor processing a noticable amount. (This
paragraph may be an aside to my real problem, the first paragraph
above; but I thought I should be complete in my description.)

At any rate, has anyone else suffered from a backlog of email
processing creating lots and lots of sendmail processes?  Is there,
perhaps, a way to limit the number of sendmail processes?

Any ideas would be welcome.

Thanks,
Joe

I haven't seen what you describe, but I just saw something close to what you 
describe.  I think the message that's being incorrectly highlighted as current
is related to the current message in the other folder rather than being n+1.

I'll have to investigate a bit more to identify and fix the bug, but there is 
something going on here.

Polite and respectful protest is acceptable then. No dumping tea in the 
harbour or anything like that.
I think the primary purpose of loud and rowdy protests is to get on 
television, and that the tactics can be
justified as a reaction to a systematic removal of alternative 
viewpoints from that medium. On the other hand,
it was a priceless TV moment. There was nothing resembling assault, and 
the protestors were not in anybody's face
(at least in my understanding of the vernacular).

And no, being rude and disrespectful is not the way to influence 
politicians, but the standard way of using lobbyists and
writing checks is beyond many of us.

Classic X copy-and-paste behavior is that you can only paste what is
currently highlighted.  In fact, it is the act of highlighting a
selection that actually copies that selection into the buffer.  X has
no ""copy"" command -- if you highlighted it, you just copied it.

If ab application has a ""copy"" command that you can choose to use
separately from the process of highlighting something, that command
is something the application authors wrote on their own.  (And it it
likely that an application that wrote an internal ""copy"" command would
also have their own customized ""paste"" command, to make sure the two
work together.)  Whether the internal (custom) select and paste
functions interoperate with the X server's global select and paste
functions will vary from program to program, because in each case you
are relying on the program's authors' efforts to blend separate systems.

Japanese toilet technology has developed creeping featuritis. New Tokyo toities 
sport speech-recognition, air-conditioning, and body-chemistry monitors: 

    Japan's toilet wars started in February, when Matsushita engineers here 
    unveiled a toilet seat equipped with electrodes that send a mild electric 
    charge through the user's buttocks, yielding a digital measurement of 
    body-fat ratio. 

    Unimpressed, engineers from a rival company, Inax, counterattacked in April 
    with a toilet that glows in the dark and whirs up its lid after an infrared 
    sensor detects a human being. When in use, the toilet plays any of six 
    soundtracks, including chirping birds, rushing water, tinkling wind chimes, 
    or the strumming of a traditional Japanese harp.

The restrictive law regarding audio is actually the accumulated cruft of
30 years of various legislative acts. The totality of what we have now
come from various parts of all the following re: sound recordings:

1998 - DMCA
1995 - Digital Performance Right in Sound Recordings Act
1992 - Audio Home Recording Act
1976 - Copyright Act amendment
1972 - Copyright Act amendment

It is worth noting that many people have forgotten about the 1976
Copyright Act Amendment which created the foundational law stating that
the copyright owners have the right to limit personal use of audio
recordings after First Sale even if you are not ""making copies"" in any
commercial sense.  Sound recordings, for many intents and purposes, are
explicitly excluded from Fair Use by the 1976 amendment.

I feel so tremendously validated right now in all my criticisms of Netscape vs. 
Mozilla. I told Netscape management that if the Netscape beta shipped without 
popup blocking that CNet would write an article on it. They didn't believe me 
(or didn't care). Sure enough, the article appeared right on time[1].

I blogged about two main annoyances when installing Netscape 7: the lack of 
popup blocking and all of the annoying advertising spam on the desktop and in 
the toolbars. I warned Netscape that they needed to take steps to correct this 
problem. They didn't listen. Take a look at the CNet review[2] highlight that 
describes *The Bad* part of Netscape 7.0:

_Displays AOL ads everywhere; doesn't let you turn off pop-up windows like 
Mozilla does; devours 30MB of disk space._

Plenty of other engineers at Netscape (as well as managers) complained about 
these problems and fought with those higher up to correct these problems. We 
lost every battle. The simple truth is that the people in charge of running the 
Netscape browser are incompetent. They don't understand how to make a good 
browser, or they don't care. Their engineers tell them what they're doing 
wrong, and they don't listen. 

Maybe you'll listen to the public. How about eWeek's article, Netscape 7.0 
Shrivels Under Mozilla's Shadow[3]? Are you paying attention now, you ignorant, 
stupid, incompetent buffoons?

""I told you so."" never felt so good.

Maybe they will sit up and take notice now. If they do, well, it's about 
fucking time. And people wonder why I quit working for AOL.

In which world are we talking about?  That may be true for the first sale,

you're definition, he just stole from you.

Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away is a 
perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  In many places, it's 
called ""advertising"": ""buy one, get one free"", ""free shipping on any order 
over $25"", ""buy this couch, and get a coffee table for free"", ""free popcorn 
with any movie rental"", ""free doorprize to the first 100 people who enter"", 
""the author will be signing books (for free) at such and such bookstore"".

Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  Just because you 
(and the entertainment industry, it seems) can't be creative enough to come 
up with a business model to leverage free stuff into paid stuff... don't 
take it out on the rest of us.

Yes, I will, sometime, after I look at the nmh sources and see what
they have managed to break, and why.

But we really want exmh to operate with all the versions of nmh that
exist, don't we?   The patch to have exmh do the right thing, whether this
bug exists, or not, is trivial, so I'd suggest including it.

Patch follows ...

I have no idea why the sequences were being added after the message list
before, not that it should make any difference to nmh (or MH).   But since
I stopped doing that, the variable ""msgs"" isn't really needed any more,
rather than assigning $pick(msgs) to msgs, and then using $msgs the code
could just use $pick(msgs) where $msgs is now used.   This is just a
frill though, so I didn't change that.

",Ham
layer UI for toddlers,"So, like many young children, my daughter Tatum (age 21 months) *really*
likes music. She also likes to have control over her environment, and this
means she wants to be the one putting CDs into the CD player, and getting
the music playing.

By watching Tatum, I've discovered that you can learn a lot about UI design
from watching 21-month-olds use technology. There is definitely a market
niche for a toddler-friendly CD/MP3 player.

The CD player we have combines play and pause in a single button, but
doesn't provide *instantaneous* feedback that the button was pushed, instead
requiring you to wait until the music starts, 5-10 seconds. This is a UI
disaster. Since Tatum doesn't get feedback right away, she presses the
button again, thereby pausing the CD before it even plays. She'll only ever
get music if she presses the button an odd number of times. This happens a
surprising amount of the time, since she eventually hits the button again
when the music doesn't play.

For toddlers, pressing play must cause the music to start immediately,
within half a second, for the toddler to get the causality and not press the
button multiple times. As well, pressing the button multiple times shouldn't
change the semantics, like an elevator button. No matter how many times you
press, the elevator still comes to that floor. The play button needs to be
the same.

The back-hinged door mechanism feeding the CD into the player is also a UI
disaster for Tatum. Since the door hinges on the back, Tatum has to angle
CDs to put them in, and take them out. Putting CDs in isn't much of a
problem, but taking them out is. Since Tatum grabs CDs by the back edge,
that edge comes out first, hitting the lid. Tatum eventually forces and
wiggles the CD out, a process that's hard on the CD and the player (but
which hasn't yet resulted in the CD player being broken). Surprisingly, it
hasn't been a problem getting the CD hole onto the spindle -- Tatum seems to
understand this concept, and the CD load area geometry naturally guides the
CD.

Tatum's CD player also plays tapes and has FM radio. For a toddler, this is
a mistake. Tatum doesn't understand the need to flick a switch to put the
player into a specific mode. She understands putting a CD in, and pressing
the play button. She sometimes understands the buttons for advancing a song,
but uses them erratically. As well, the radio feature has both FM mono and
FM stero, a distinction totally lost on Tatum. Tatum only understands the
binary distinction of music/no music.

What would the ideal toddler CD player be like? It would immediately start
playing a CD after it was loaded. As soon as the CD load door was closed, it
would give some audible feedback. It would have a single large play button.
The other typical CD controls would be larger than normal, but at least half
the size of the play button, and located far away from the play button, so
there is no chance of them getting accidentally pressed on the way to play.
The play button would be a bright color that is different from the color of
the player, and different from the color of the other CD control keys. The
device would only play CDs, no other functions. The CD load area would flip
open at least 80 degrees. It should be small, approachable for a toddler. It
should be possible to repeatedly drop the player from a height of 1-2'
without affecting the player.

I don't care if the mail is foldered on python.org, but personal
messages regardless of who they're for, shouldn't be part of the
public spambayes repository unless specifically approved by both the
recipient and sender.

Note also that we are much more liberal about python.org/zope.org
mailing list traffic than most folks.  Read list-managers for any
length of time and you'll find that there are a lot of people who
assert strict copyright over their collections, are very protective of
their traffic, and got really pissed when gmane just started
gatewaying their messages without asking.

Which might be an appropriate for their lists, but not for ours (don't
think I'm suggesting we do the same -- I /like/ our laissez-faire
approach).

But for personal email, we should be more careful.

Well, with 7.0, I've seen a few problems with doing that, but as of 7.2
it's really wonderful! Ever tried of completely uninstalling all openssh
related packages while being connected through ssh? Well, it works!!!! Of
course, if the connection cuts at that moment, you're stuck, but a simple
upgrade with official Red Hat packages also works like a charm :-)

It is actually a lot worse than this.  What it boils down to is that
only the privileged class is really allowed to start a serious company. 
What I found fascinating is that the old French aristocracy effectively
still exists (literally the same families), but they now hold top
executive and management positions in the major French firms and the
government, positions which are only passed on to other blue bloods. Not
officially of course, but as a strict matter of practice.  And the laws
and legal structures make sure that this system stays firmly in place. 
Even for a young French blue blood, strict age hierarchies keep them
from branching out into a new venture in their own country (though many
can leverage this to start companies in OTHER countries).  I know about
the French system first-hand and the executives are quite candid about
it (at least to Yanks like me who are working with them), but I suspect
this may hold true for other European countries as well.  

After all those ""revolutions"", France is still nothing more than a
thinly veiled old-school aristocracy, with all the trappings.

The above steps can all be performed ""automatically"",
if the .spec files are updated to include the necessary
macros in the %prep (%setup -q) and %build stages.
This would make the building of the .rpm files less
error prone and more self-contained, and it would be
somewhat self-documenting.

If anyone here is running (null) beta then you may like these Gnome theme packages.
They are enhanced and repackages from my previous theme packs, this time to conform
to the way pre-release RH8 handles themes for GTK1 and GTK2.

RedHat has a preferences -> themes app, but themes only show up there that have BOTH
gtk1.2 (Gnome1) themes AND gtk1.4 (GTK2 aka Gnome2) themes available. Then RH will
apply the theme to both GTK versions, so the user does not really notice that
different GTK toolkit versions are being used, since they *should* look the same.

This ""gtk2-engines-compat"" RPM has GTK2 ported themes for those themes that are
included in the RH package ""gtk-engines"" themes pack for GTK1.

The ""gtk1+2-themez"" pack mostly repackages my previous theme RPMs in a way that the
(null) btea like, and supposedly the next RH8 when released :)

How is this any different from attaching an Infobot or A.L.I.C.E
through licq's console-hook?  People have been doing that for years,
and for over a decade in IRC and the MUDs.

... and the one thing I think we've learned in all that time is that,
as a help-desk, it doesn't work.  People just don't like talking to
robots, especially when the robots, once confused, become imbeciles.
I think the humans may feel cheated, deceived and tricked when they
discover, as with the Seattle answer, that they are talking to a
machine; there's no real intelligence behind that simulated-friendly
and therefore empty 'thx'.

AIML is clever and cute, but for /practical/ applications as a first
line of technical support?  It's been tried over and over, and while I
/also/ think that it /should/ work, for the most part, people won't
use it.  What's worse, as we make the NL processing more and more
clever, it only means it fails more dramatically; ALICE doesn't just
stumble a bit, it starts to drool.  And ALICE is the best we have.

Like a Dalek: All very impressive when things are going well, but all
it takes to betray the chicken-brain inside is a towel over it's
ill-placed eye, or a spin off the metal surface ;)

In all the prolog-based NL database query systems of the 1980's and
other later chatterbot helpdesk projects like Shallow Red, even

Are the people who use procrustean web
forms practices the same ones who don't
accept faxes?

When I *really* need to get something
done, instead of just idle surfing, I
call or fax.  Faxing, like a web form,
can be done 24x7; it allows me to give
all the (and only the) pertinent info

I've been running a tiled (but somewhat
overlapped, yielding a horizontal stack)
window manager lately.  Like filling in
a web form, finding edges and shuffling
windows may seem productive, but I find
that having a window manager manage the
windows means I can concentrate on what
I want to do with their contents.

Back in my day, when one changed computer

Now, we seem to have swung so far in the

Thanks for the script.  It also appears that the standard logrotate tools
included with many systems (or at least RedHat systems) will support
wildcards when rotating files so something like

All of these ""af6"" are related to avifile6 support :-/
Normally, my 0.6.1-fr2 build of transcode defaults to *not* use avifile,
but you can use ""--with avifile6"" to force recompiling against it.

Do you have an old avifile installed maybe?
Can you check the ""./configure ..."" line run at the beginning of the

From,"This is not an exmh problem, but an interaction between sendmail, Solaris and 
mh.

Your sysadmin is wrong.  It is the responsibility of the receiving mail 
server to escape lines beginning with ""From "" if they choose to turn on that 
facility.  It is not the responsibility for email clients to cater to the 
stupid design of the unix mail spool, and Sun's even more stupid decision to 
rely on ""Content-length:"" instead of dealing with this problem.  Since mh is 
unaware of ""Content-length:"", rcvstore gags trying to parse messages from the 
spool.

I had this same problem.  There are several ways to fix it:

1)  Get your mail administrator to add the ""E"" flag to your sendmail.  This 
means you will never see a line beginning with ""From "".  Any such line will 
look like "">From "".

2)  There is a patch to mh to make it respect ""Content-length:"".  When I was 
having this problem, porting this patch to nmh was low on the priority list, 
then nmh development stalled for a long time.  I doubt it has been done, but 
you can check with the nmh list at nmh-workers@mhost.com to find out for sure.

3)  You can learn to use procmail, invoking rcvstore directly instead of 
letting sendmail put your incoming mail into the spool.  This avoids the 
whole issue.  rcvstore only deals with a single message at a time, and 
everything works.

Not to beat a dead horse, but that's exactly what my spamcan package
did.  For those just tuning in, spamcan is a thingy I wrote before I
knew about Tim & co's work on this crazy stuff; you can download it from
<http://woozle.org/~neale/src/spamcan/spamcan.html>, but I'm not going
to work on it anymore.

I'm currently writing a new one based on classifier (and timtest's
booty-kicking tokenizer).  I'll probably have something soon, like maybe
half an hour, and no, it's not too hard.  The hard part is storing the
data somewhere.  I don't want to use ZODB, as I'd like something a
person can just drop in with a default Python install.  So anydbm is
looking like my best option.

I already have a setup like this using Xavier Leroy's SpamOracle, which
does the same sort of thing.  You call it from procmail, it adds a new
header, and then you can filter on that header.  Really easy.

Here's how I envision this working.  Everybody gets four new mailboxes:

  train-eggs
  train-spam
  trained-eggs
  trained-spam

You copy all your spam and eggs* into the ""train-"" boxes as you get it.
How frequently you do this would be up to you, but you'd get better
results if you did it more often, and you'd be wise to always copy over
anything which was misclassified.  Then, every night, the spam fairy
swoops down and reads through your folders, learning about what sorts of
things you think are eggs and what sorts of things are spam.  After she's
done, she moves your mail into the ""trained-"" folders.

This would work for anybody using IMAP on a Unix box, or folks who read
their mail right off the server.  I've spoken with some fellows at work
about Exchange and they seem to beleive that Exchange exports
appropriate functionality to implement a spam fairy as well.

Advanced users could stay ahead of the game by reprogramming their mail
client to bind the key ""S"" to ""move to train-spam"" and ""H"" to ""move to
train-eggs"".  Eventually, if enough people used this sort of thing, it'd
start showing up in mail clients.  That's the ""delete as spam"" button
Paul Graham was talking about.

* The Hormel company might not think well of using the word ""ham"" as the
  opposite of ""spam"", and they've been amazingly cool about the use of
  their product name for things thus far.  So I propose we start calling
  non-spam something more innocuous (and more Monty Pythonic) such as
  ""eggs"".

Look at /etc/apt/apt.conf. I think ^kernel$ matches the kernel packages
(apart from those matched by the rest, smp, enterprise).
I think it won't do anything about the kernels. Come to think of it, the
abovementioned might have nothing to do with it.

I explicitly use apt-get install kernel and then from the list pick a

Should. Haven't tried with dist-upgrade but I have put 7.2 netboot
mirror (ie, 7.2) into sources.list and run install step-by-step for IIRC
everything. Worked ok. I think there'll be a few .rpmnew files worth
checking such as, especially, passwd and group.
I think there was a group change. ""lock"" ?

Writing an IMAP server is a non-trivial task.  The specification is huge
and clients do all kinds of weird stuff.  POP is very easy in
comparison.  Perhaps you could forward messages to a special address or
save them in a special folder to mark them as false negatives.

Alternatively, perhaps there could be a separate protocol and client
that could be used to review additions to the training set.  Each day a
few random spam and ham messages could be grabbed as candidates.
Someone would periodically startup the client, review the candidates,
reclassify or remove any messages they don't like and add them to the
training set.

I've never heard of any CD-ROM or DVD-ROM drive having problems with DMA...
although there probably is since Red Hat decided to default disabling it a
few releases back :-/
Normally, even if you try to enable DMA and your device doesn't support it,
it simply don't be able to make the change, and that's it. The problem IIRC
is with crappy hardware that is supposed to support DMA but doesn't work as
expected when it's enabled... maybe Chris could confirm this? ;-)

I guess I'll settle for the /dev/dvd link change as described and putting

DVDSynth is an open source project that allows you to splice in your own

insert your own non-sucky subtitles, make and circulate edit-lists that make 
highlight reels for your favorite movies, etc, etc. It all amounts to a sweet 
tool for making the audience into the _former audience_, participants in 
entertainment. Of course, it's also illegal under the DMCA, since the tool also

Trying to shoutdown a speaker or being loud and rowdy while someone else is
trying to speak (in the vernacular, 'getting in their face') is rude and
disrespectful.  And persistently getting in someones face is assault, a
criminal offense. If these people have something to say, they can say it
with signs or get their own venue.  And here is something else to chew on...
these protesters are NOT interested in changing anyones mind about what
Rumsfield is saying. How likely are you to change someone's mind by being
rude and disrespectful to them? Is this how to win friends and influence
people? Either these folks are social misfits who have no understanding of
human interactions (else they would try more constructive means to get their
message across) or they are just out to get their rocks off regardless of
how it affects other people, and that is immoral at best and downright evil
at worst.

that isn't covered by hammie.py?  About the only useful feature of
GBayes.py that hammie.py doesn't (yet) copy is -u, which calculates
spamness for an entire mailbox.  This feature can easily be copied
into hammie.py.  (GBayes.py also has a large collection of tokenizers;
but timtoken.py rules, so I'm not sure how interesting that is now.)

Therefore I propose to nuke GBayes.py, after adding a -u feature.

------- Additional Comments From alan@rdrop.com  2002-09-05 22:22 -------
I haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires File::Spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it.  I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's
because I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  The perl @ stuff
was bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...

Yes, you read the links.

Sorry, but exposing folly is not only humorous but also instructive.  It
is only by exposing folly to ridicule that you stop it in the first
place.

'Brickbats' leans heavily on both, though the item I highlighted was a
'horror' item not a 'gee that is stupid' item.  For an example of the
latter, see the city that wanted a woman to pay a ticket for parking in

There must be *some* way of tracking a spammer down, since they are planning 
on making money from the spam.  What a court would consider evidence of being 
the spammer is another question.

Well, I'm sure you can recompile those game packages without ALSA anyway.
Also, note that ALSA 0.9.x has just appeared in Mandrake 9.0 and that all
previous Mandrake releases were using the incompatible, aging and now
unsupported 0.5.x series. (unless I've misunderstood)

Near to none, it should be quite straightforward :
http://freshrpms.net/docs/alsa/

The only tricky part is editing the /etc/modules.conf file, but the ALSA
Soundcard Matrix has a page for every supported card with a section you can
most of the time simply copy and paste!

I really think that with my ALSA packages, ALSA on Red Hat Linux has never
been so easy! ;-)

Adding -r to the sort options, and piping through head instead,
might be a better idea. tail needs to read teh whole buffer, head
only reads the first n lines.

I see no reason why both approaches could and should not be used.
MTA level filtering would just need to use a different corpus, one that 
would contain illegal or otherwise commonly unapproved material for the 
group of people using that MTA.   I'm sure that such an approach would 
significantly reduce the mail traffic as a first step, without  giving  
false positives.

MUA corpus would then be personally trained -- although I'd like the 
option of 'down-loadable' corpuses and merge functionality.

I think people will be much more motivated to report spam than ham.  I
like the general approach that copies of random messages will be
sequestered for some period of time before they're assumed to be ham.
Matched with a simple spam reporting scheme, this could keep the
training up to date with little effort.  I've sketched out an approach
a listserver like Mailman could do along these lines and if I get some
free time I'll hack something together.

I like the idea of a POP proxy which is classifying messages as
they're pulled from the server.  The easiest way for such a beast to
be notified of spam might be to simply save the spam in a special
folder or file that the POP proxy would periodically consult.

I thought this nekkid URL was going to be about the
infringement of 1st amendment rights for broadcasters
and proposed campaign finanice restrictions preventing them
from making money on advertisements that are deemed
thinly veiled campaign contributions by some arbitrary
government board.  As it was posted to ""discussion"" I
thought there'd be some.

Instead it's a Post-Gazette column by Brian O'Neill
lamenting the fact that some people know how to
fill out a permit so that they can take advantage
of their right to peaceable assembly.  Obviously
he's poking fun at the idea that specific groups
get specific ""zones"" and that it's not up to the
police to decide what messages and signs get put into
what zones to most expediently keep order.  

The problem is that politics have gotten so muddied
nowadays, that shouting down and unpeaceably disrupting
political rallies that you don't agree with has become
common practice.  The courts have constantly ruled
that there are some restrictions on the first amendment.
They teach you that your very first year of law school.

I think that given the information as laid out by the story,
Mr. O'Neill has confused free speech with action.  Free
speech or even protected speech as practiced by almost 
every American seems to involve the ability to communicate
an idea to an unknown audience.  Action involves directing
a specific comment to a specific well-defined individual or audience
that has immediate, harmful, and sometimes physical 
effects that is easily forseeable by any reasonable person. 

I think Bill Neel of Butler needs to go back to school
as obviously he must have been sleeping in his civics

alk] OT: DNS MX Record Clarification Please,"
This may be a little off topic but thought people here would have a better
response to this elsewhere.

I have setup two MX records (mail and bmail) for my mail server. The one I
gave a 10 (bmail) the other a 20 (mail).

bmail(10) I gave a 10 because I want all mail to go through this server to
be scanned for SPAM and viruses and then relayed to the mail(20) server for
delivery.

As I understand it, DNS A records are used in a rotating fashion for load
balancing, but DNS MX records are used in order or prority, meaning the 10
before the 20 and only 20 if the 10 isn't available.

But only some of the mail is actually being scanned which leads me to
believe that not all of the mail is actually hitting that box and the 10
never goes down. Why? Have I got something confused here?

Thanks,
V

How about enabling the ""Show unseen message count in folder cache""

(if greater than 0), so you don't really need the unseen window unless

Funny, I was in the middle of composing the same message when I saw yours.

It would be nice if it sees a header like:
Content-type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1

and defang_mime is 0, it could wrap the report with <pre></pre> for ease
of reading?

And the same sort of problem seems to occur with base64 encoded messages.
The report is placed inside of the mime boundary:

_Anil Dash_: XML version 1.0[1]. &#8220;Why isn't there a way to syndicate my 
words without butchering the way they look?&#8221; Several people protested 
last week by changing their weblog templates to something like this[2]. Jason 
Levine has more links[3] to those involved. I spoke with one of the people who 
implemented it, and she claims it wasn't a protest as such, more of an inside 
joke. Point taken: the entire point of an aggregator (and syndication in 
general) is to make everyone's words look the same. Counterpoint: the default 
in most weblog systems is to only publish excerpts in RSS feeds; nobody's 
forcing you to publish full posts. This would probably be a good place to 
insert a Zen quote about attachment, but my mind is too fuzzy to find it.

I'm not familiar with Dell Dimension XPS, and, to be honest, not familiar
with any brand-name computers. Most of my experience is China

that time. It was big round battery with 'Panasonic' on it.
Computer starts beeping then we removed battery from MB. It even booted up
(well, loosing time and some other things).

Just my 2 cents.

zteana] That wacky imam,"http://media.guardian.co.uk/broadcast/comment/0,7493,781769,00.html

Hamza's horrid - but we must tolerate him

Rod Liddle
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Sheikh Abu Hamza al-Masri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman
to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing
with his own children in Victoria Park, Hackney.
I've often wondered what incendiary Islamic fundamentalist clerics do on
statutory public holidays. Head for the beach and maybe swing by B&Q on the
way home, I had hoped. I had this beguiling vision of Hamza paddling in the
sea, an ice-cream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins,
and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen
for once, instead of planning the extermination of Zionism and America and
maybe me and you, too.
But B&Q and a day at the seaside is probably beyond Hamza's budget since the
Bank of England froze his assets, so Victoria Park had to do. But he sounded
happy enough when I spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, Islamic
proto-warriors in the background.
You must know Hamza; he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the Daily
Mail's cartoonist Mac. Large metal hook in place of a left hand. One eye
covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milky-white. We don't
mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like Hamza whom
we don't like; then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come
off. So Hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the
British right) as ""Captain Hook"", in articles which usually call for his
arrest, or extradition to the US, or deportation back home to Egypt or maybe
off to Pakistan or Afghanistan, where he fought the Russians for years and
thus sustained his disabilities - anywhere, really; just out of here. And if
we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him
to shut up.
Because we don't like Hamza very much. We weren't that fond of him before
September 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all
thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political
persecution.
And now the Daily Mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've
got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory
manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of Islam. All out of
context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. But
perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broad-mindedness and
tolerance towards people like Hamza was thinning even before the Mirror's
scoop.
Hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary Finsbury Park Mosque - so, earlier
this year, the Charity Commissioners banned him from doing so because of his
allegedly inflammatory remarks. I didn't know Charity Commissioners were
meant to do stuff like that.
He has had his passport seized and not returned; his assets have been
frozen. He is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the
media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations
and the press. And this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly
- repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be
true - Hamza is not ""representative"" of British Muslims, as if British
Muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could
turn to every now and then for explanation. And perhaps succour.
The trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was
revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those
government-approved Muslim spokesmen who were - uncomfortably, I suspect -
dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism
and a blanket condemnation of the Taliban.
An opinion poll commissioned by Radio 4's Today programme revealed that an
overwhelming majority of British Muslims were against George Bush's crusade.
One in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the US
(the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). A large majority thought
the war against terrorism was a war against Islam.
Which is what Hamza said, repeatedly. But it was something that, at the
time, we didn't want to hear. Now, if you quiz the man on present policy at
home and abroad he comes across - superficially, at least - as someone from
the liberal left. No war against Iraq; Britain to become independent of US
foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with Arab states; stronger action
against Israel; mistrust of global capitalism; redistribution of wealth.
Nor is he particularly anti-semitic, so far as I can tell, although I don't
suppose he will be holidaying in Eilat this year. In yesterday's Guardian,
the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to Hamza and was grateful
for the sheikh's message of condolence when a London synagogue was attacked.
Which is not to say that Hamza is a peaceable Jeffersonian democrat who has
been wilfully misrepresented: he is, without question, rather more
inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. His
ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of Islam: he would be
happy, in a truly Islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for
example. You and I would find many - perhaps most - of his views utterly
repellent.
And that's the point. Because Hamza is the true test of our apparent desire
to be multicultural. Multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful
appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the
ruling hegemony. That is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism.
Multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that
are antithetical to the dominant culture - and maybe learn from them.
The FBI has been investigating Hamza, but, of course, has found nothing
remotely incriminating. The real reason for his vilification and persecution
is simply the pungency of his views.
It is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his
rhetoric increases hostility against the Muslim population generally. This
is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash.
You don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. And
if British Muslims - maybe a minority, maybe not - feel a growing sense of
unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is
not because they have been led in that direction by Hamza. Shutting the man
up, therefore, won't make a difference.
It is rather as Louis MacNeice had it:
The glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever.
But if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.

I view IMAP as a stop-gap measure until tighter integration with various email clients 
can be achieved.

I still feel it's better to require classification feedback from the recipient, rather than 
make any assumptions after some period of time passes. But this is an end-user issue 
and we're still at the algorithm stage.. ;-)

That's exactly what is intended; the idea is that legit senders who

As game developers reach for new forms of gameplay and a better process for

becoming inescapable. Physics engines do more than just knock over boxes, 
however, and the interface between your game and a physics engine must be 
fairly complex in order to harness advanced functionality.

sprint delivers the next big thing??,"right Mike,

i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart.  my opinion is
only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant
show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing).  i am
mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.

my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways
once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see
amongst each other.  that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on
their phones, or that people will spend more time w/images than voice.  just
that it is fundamental.  from news to crime to privacy to dating to family
life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion
of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of
their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of
photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes
things 'big time'.

rob

This does nothing to answer my question.  I *do* care about content.  Hell,
if I could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth
all day, I'd have a different opinion of this.  I just am not convinced
that they will (stupid or not).

While a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same
argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who
communicate by pictures?  Sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is
such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find
yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?

I don't buy it.

For most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient
mechanism.  For some messages, pictures do the job, but I would say not
nearly as often as words.  Why do you think Pictionary and Charades and
such are games?  Because images are usually not the most efficient way to
get a message across.

Again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just
don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this"").  I wasn't saying
that MMS wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't
easy.  I was saying that I couldn't see why people would use it in a way
that ""changed the face of communications"".

I'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why
people would want to do this.  Sure, if they integrate cameras into the
phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) I can certainly see
people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to
other people.  But, mostly, I don't see what the benefit is to this over
sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or
offline) photoalbum.

I don't think 1 hour photos are trivial.  People want to see their own pics
right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots.  That's
one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on.  The instant
view part.  I'm guessing your argument is that people not only want
""instant view"", but also ""instant show"".  Which is what this service
offers.  I'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"".  I think
people like to package their pictures and show them.  That's why people put
together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while
they explain every picture.  Sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but
it's just ""nice"" on occasion.  I still can't see how it becomes a integral
messaging method.

What's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it
from one phone to another?  There has to be *some* benefit, even if it's
silly if people are going to flock to it.

I'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.

The *only* really intriguing idea I've heard about things like MMS lately
are Dan Gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event
will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile
phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of
what happened - before the press even gets there.

Willing to be proven wrong,
Mike

PS If the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as
they currently are, then MMS is *never* going to catch on.

I hadn't tried that.  I figured it was better to find out if ""all but

Spammers could exploit this including a large MIME part at the beginning

I've done that too, on many production servers. The only little
(unimportant) catch is to replace ""kernel-headers"" by ""glibc-kernheaders"",
a simple ""apt-get install glibc-kernheaders"" taking care of that.

Upgrading between releases is meant to work, not between betas or beta and
releases. The reason is simple : Some packages may have been downgraded,
some others may have been rebuilt with the same versions but different
dependencies. For both these categories of packages, the upgrade through
apt/rhn/whatever just won't do, as some older packages might be considered
as the newest, thus being kept on the system.

As Red Hat does, I really don't recommend trying to upgrade between betas
or from a beta to a final release either. Simply backup your /home, /etc
(and /root and/or /usr/local/ if needed) then reinstall cleanly, it'll
probably save a few hassles and you'll get the cleanest possible system ;-)

Goodbye Global Warming,"""the historical record"", by which you mean *human* historical record, is
highly overrated (nigh worthless) when you are talking about geological
timescales, even on topics with as short a timescale as climate.

My problem with global warming (or cooling for that matter), is that the
supposedly profound recent changes in temperature, both in absolute
terms and as a function time, very arguably fall well below the noise
floor of the natural fluctuations that have occurred over the last
50,000 years both in terms of absolute average temperature and the rate
of temperature change.  People unfamiliar with history of global
temperature since the advent of modern humans may think that a degree
here or there over a century is a lot, not realizing that global
temperatures regularly whipsaw with far greater extremity.  I therefore 
immediately dismiss any theory of global warming that cannot explain why
temperatures whipsawed more severely in pre-history than in the last
couple thousand years (which have been relatively calm by geological
standards).  This is a very inconvenient fact for people trying to use
climate to push a particular social agenda.

It is worth noting that underneath the receding glaciers deposited
during the last major ice age, they are finding substantial evidence of
humans living in what was a nice temperate climate before the glaciers
paved over their civilization.  The receding glaciers have turned into a
bit of an archaeological treasure chest, as they expose artifacts buried
in and underneath them as they shrink that have been preserved by the
ice for thousands of years.  I don't see any compelling reason to ""save
the glaciers"" anyway, particularly in light of the fact that their
existence has always been transient.

For anyone to insist that the current negligible fluctuations are
anthropogenic just heaps one ridiculous assertion upon another.  I'll
just stick with Occam's Razor for now.

In my humble opinion.

Cheers,

XDegrees founder Michael Tanne was offered a job, but decided instead to
play his hand in the Silicon Valley.

Working at Lewis & Clark College, the University of California at Berkeley, 
the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Stanford University, 
the interdisciplinary team:

    * confirmed speculation that the gecko's amazing climbing ability 
depends on weak molecular attractive forces called van der Waals forces,

    * rejected a competing model based on the adhesion chemistry of water 
molecules, and

* discovered that the gecko's adhesive depends on geometry, not surface 
chemistry. In other words, the size and shape of the tips of gecko foot 
hairs--not what they are made of--determine the gecko's stickiness.

To verify its experimental and theoretical results, the gecko group then 
used its new data to fabricate prototype synthetic foot-hair tips from two 
different materials.

""Both artificial setal tips stuck as predicted,"" notes Autumn, assistant 
professor of biology at Lewis & Clark College in Portland, Ore. ""Our 
initial prototypes open the door to manufacturing the first biologically

Hi,

First of all, sorry for not replying to your private email from last week,
but I really don't have a slight idea of what could be causing this!
- Is this with different DVDs or a single one?
- Is this using OSS or ALSA? Have you tried both?
- Is this using binariy packages or recompiling source ones?

I remember a user having trouble with a particular DVD ever since upgrading
libdvdcss to a recent version, but haven't heard the end of the story.

Date: Not supplied

I've been snowed under for the last four weeks, working on the FogBUGZ 3.0 
Setup program. 

For various reasons none of the commercial setup toolkits (Wise, InstallShield, 
Windows Installer) could do even 25% of what our setup program needed to do, so 
I ended up writing it from scratch. VC++ and MFC all the way. It took longer 
than I expected because I had this weird conviction that the entire setup 
process should be completely reversable, and as you go backwards through the 
wizard it should automatically and silently undo any changes it had already 
made. So even if you're looking at the last screen, if you decide you want to 
change where to extract the files, you can just back up and change it and 
everything moves and all the old files you overwrote are put back and all the 
Windows accounts you created are uncreated and all the permissions we granted 
are ungranted and the SQL database you made is unmade and so on. The end result 
is a great setup program, but it may be a tad overkill. If I have time I'll 
write more about what I learned. 

  

One benefit of writing a setup program from scratch is that I don't have to 
have someone else's stupid cartoon-of-a-computer-and-floppy-disks in the upper 
right hand corner. I used a photograph of the London Skyline, currently 
infested with cranes. I took the picture from the cafe at the Tate Modern.

Actually, this issue used to escalate into a religious war. The ""From "" 
envelope is an artifact of the mbox mailbox format, and from that 
perspective it should be the mail server that stores its mailboxes in
mbox format that should be responsible for escaping lines beginning with 
""From "". On the other hand, this breaks the assumption that the mail 
transport only touches the message headers and leaves the message body 
alone.
Things like pgp signatures break when the mail server changes the message 
body.

Also, strictly speaking, the mbox format envelope (or for us old-timers, 
the UUCP envelope) isn't just any line beginning with ""From "". It's really 
""From"", a single space, a valid email address, two spaces, and a valid 
date.
For example:

Dunno about the other tools, but SpamAssassin is a breeze to incorporate
into a procmail environment.  Lots of people use it in many other ways.  For
performance reasons, many people run a spamd process and then invoke a small
C program called spamc which shoots the message over to spamd and passes the
result back out.  I think spambayes in incremental mode is probably fast
enough to not require such tricks (though I would consider changing the
pickle to an anydbm file).

Basic procmail usage goes something like this:

    :0fw
    | spamassassin -P

    :0
    * ^X-Spam-Status: Yes
    $SPAM

Which just says, ""Run spamassassin -P reinjecting its output into the
processing stream.  If the resulting mail has a header which begins
""X-Spam-Status: Yes"", toss it into the folder indicated by the variable
$SPAM.

SpamAssassin also adds other headers as well, which give you more detail
about how its tests fared.  I'd like to see spambayes operate in at least
this way: do its thing then return a message to stdout with a modified set
of headers which further processing downstream can key on.

ving Memorial,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Say 'amen' somebody. What the WSJ said, appended below.


The WTC, as constructed, was a confiscatory government boondoggle,
expropriated from the original pre-construction property owners at
the behest of a third-generation trust-fund-aristocrat for the ""good""
of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else
to do after it, and its coach-hounds in organized labor and organized
crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest
nation.

Now, of course, it's about to get worse. The sins of 40 years ago
have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally
irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in
government.

As a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly
usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will
be ""granted"" away  in a potlatch that only government, and
special-interest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the
cryptosocialist psycho-rabble call themselves this week) can organize
to such perfection.


All this in probably the *only* city in the country that was founded
by a *business*, explicitly for the purpose of *commerce*. Not
religious fanaticism. Not colonial expansion in a monarch's name.
*Commerce*.


If they *really* wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites
who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects
on a plane full of government-disarmed passengers) the so-called
""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the
highest bidder and let the *market* -- the cure to all luddism,
foreign and domestic, government and superstitious -- decide.

If the new, *private* owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for
a memorial, fine. They could sell tickets and donate the money to the
families of the dead and injured. Probably great for marketing the
property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the
event.

And, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as
tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square
feet, splendid. Whatever the market will bear.


In these days of increasingly ubiquitous trans-national geodesic
internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially
decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries,
economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition
and statism.

It's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower
Manhattan mega-real-estate to prevail this early in the game, but
it's going to happen sooner or later.

And, whenever it does, *that* will be a fitting memorial to those who
died at the World Trade Center.

Cheers,
RAH

The Wall Street Journal

REVIEW & OUTLOOK

A Living Memorial

As we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the
six-story crater where the Twin Towers once stood. Like everyone
else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who
died a year ago. But we also think the best memorial to those who
perished would be a living one.

The site of the World Trade Center calls forth many emotions,
especially today: anger, grief and respect for the many acts of
heroism that took place there. But underlying it all is the memory of
the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were
attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. The best
expression of the spirit of New York and of those who died would be
to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries
working, meeting, shopping, eating -- that is, engaged in the sort of
productive work and play that used to take place there. Osama bin
Laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery.

But restoring this memory is not what the discussion in New York has
been about. So far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous
rebuilding of downtown Manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the
Trade Center fell. Instead the discussion centers on the size and
scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now
clamoring for a piece of the action. New York's political leadership,
and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance
to rebuild a better, more prosperous city.

This is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out
what to do with the site. In consultation with New York Governor
George Pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own November
re-election, the commission made the decision to focus first on the
memorial. The Manhattan Institute's Steve Malanga argues that the
commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space
for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning
to the memorial. This is in essence what the Pentagon has so
successfully done -- rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for
an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided.

A big part of the problem in New York is that the city's
anti-development activists know an opening when they see one. They
want the World Trade Center site -- and even some surrounding areas
- -- transformed into an enormous park. These political advocates have
had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in
New York into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the World
Trade Center site is now getting the same treatment. Worse, they are
cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own
anti-development agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. One
family group even called a press conference to reject as
disrespectful a proposed train line under the site.

We are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident
that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center
isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. The great
cities of Europe and Japan, devastated in World War II, have all
rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban
life. Perhaps the most powerful is found in Rotterdam, the Dutch port
city reduced to rubble by German bombing, where survivors erected a
statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be.

In this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to
be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were
affiliated. If you walk into Nassau Hall at Princeton University,
you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the Revolutionary
War, the War of 1812, the Civil War, the Spanish-American War, World
War I, World War II, Korea and Southeast Asia. No one thinks it
disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on
around the walls containing their names.

In New York now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the
emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future.
Rudolph Giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres
devoted to the memorial. Governor Pataki has called for no structures
on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would
severely curtail options. Mayor Michael Bloomberg initially raised
his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the
press and has since ducked for cover.

Maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. Maybe
those responsible for the World Trade Center site will start thinking
more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. The best
way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce.

I'm afraid rebal is quadratic-time in the # of msgs it shuffles around --
since it was only intended to move a few files around, it's dead simple.

An easy thing is to start the same way:  move all the files into a single
directory.  Then do random.shuffle() on an os.listdir() of that directory.
Then it's trivial to split the result into N slices, and move the files into
N other directories accordingly.

There's also an 'objdump' program, and 'biew' hex viewer/disassembler. A good 
starting point to search is http://www.freshmeat.net/

However, cracking and reverse engineering tools are not so ubiquitous on UNIX as 
they are on Windows platform for two main reasons:

1. The main customers of commercial Unices (Solaris, HP-UX, Aix, SCO...) are 
respectable companies. They are ready to pay big bucks for software they need: the reputation matters.

2. Most software for free and open source Unices like Linux and xBSD (this 
software often may be used on commercial unices as well) is, well, free and 
open source.

    naked. I said to the guy, ""Hey buddy, why are you doing that?""  He
    said ""Because you came home early.""

05. It's been a rough day. I got up this morning...  put a shirt on
    and button fell off.  I picked up my briefcase, and the handle
    came off.  I'm afraid to go to the bathroom.

06. I was such an ugly kid...  When I played in the sandbox, the cat
    kept covering me up.

07. I could tell my parents hated me.  My bath toys were a toaster and

08. I was such an ugly baby...  My mother never breast fed me. She
    told me that she only liked me as a friend.

09. I'm so ugly...  My father carries around a picture of the kid who

10. When I was born, the doctor came into the waiting room and said to
    my father, ""I'm sorry. We did everything we could, but he pulled
    through.""

11. I'm so ugly...  My mother had morning sickness...  AFTER I was
    born.

12. I remember the time that I was kidnapped and they sent a piece of
    my finger to my father.  He said he wanted more proof.

13. Once when I was lost, I saw a policeman, and asked him to help me
    find my parents. I said to him, ""Do you think we'll ever find
    them?"" He said,""I don't know kid. There's so many places they can
    hide.""

14. My wife made me join a bridge club. I jump off next Tuesday.

15. I'm so ugly...  I worked in a pet shop, and people kept asking how
    big I'd get.

16. I went to see my doctor. ""Doctor, every morning when I get up and
    I look in the mirror...  I feel like throwing up; What's wrong
    with me?"" He said...  ""I don't know but your eyesight is perfect.""

17. I went to the doctor because I'd swallowed a bottle of sleeping
    pills. My doctor told me to have a few drinks and get some rest.

18. With my old man I got no respect. I asked him, ""How can I get my
    kite in the air?"" He told me to run off a cliff.

19. Some dog I got. We call him Egypt because in every room he leaves
    a pyramid. His favorite bone is in my arm.  Last night he went on
    the paper four times - three of those times I was reading it.

20. One year they wanted to make me poster boy - for birth control.

Yes.

One of the nicer aspects of exmh's colour handling is that while I have
the default background for the message pane set to black, the second
insance of exmh displaying to a given $DISPLAY will set the background
of the message pane to darkslategray.  Very nice as it provides an

Subject: Living Love - Another legacy of the 60's


Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated
with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be
the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but
related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"",
hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo /
G-Force Dyno-Staff.

I have to say however that, having found this while looking for
something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the
Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.

To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular
seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some
religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very
irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and
contrast with our (my) modern mental models.

I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and
justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

How soon will you realize that the only thing you don't have is the

Love a person because he or she is there.
This is the only reason.

Happiness happens when your consciousness is not dominated by addictions

liberal defnitions,"from slate's ""today's papers"":  
The New York Times and Los Angeles Times both lead with word that
a federal judge ruled yesterday that the nation's largest
national gas pipeline company, El Paso, illegally withheld gas
from the market during California's energy squeeze in 2000-01.
The judge concluded that El Paso left 21 percent of its capacity
in the state off-line, thus driving up the price of gas and
helping to induce rolling blackouts. 

and this is the product of overregulation?

Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
regulation.

The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
tons of money on public housing.

As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
much anathema to liberal politics.

Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
regulation itself.

And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
watermelon.

That shrinks to under 2 million bytes, though, if I delete all the WordInfo

aren't needed when scoring (an unknown word gets a made-up probability of
UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB).  Such records are only needed for training; I've noted
before that a scoring-only database can be leaner.

In part the bloat is due to character 5-gram'ing, part due to that the

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh <mailto:declan.mccullagh@cnet.com>
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html?tag=prntfr>

*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*

A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> 
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.

The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
<http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada 
<http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.

Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the 
process of considering.

If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.

Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, 
or ratified, the treaty.

Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.

""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case.""

Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems.""

Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.

""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.

Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.

Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
the draft says.

Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""

""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously,"" Hosein said.

A representative for George Radwanski 
<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
the paper as it stands.""

Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca 
<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.

G] serial port transient failure,"Here's a weird and wacky problem:

I'm currently out of the country with my trusty Evo N600c laptop. When I 
tried to use the serial port to talk to my mobile phone, Linux behaved 
pretty much as if the port was fried. Bizarre, I thought, because I'd 
used it successfully while in the office. The only difference was that I 
was trying the thing in the hotel. I entertained brief notions of having 
somehow fried the serial drivers, then rebooted the laptop to Windows 
and tried again. Worked perfectly. Back to Linux. Still not talking. 
Considered that it might be flaky power, so I ran the laptop on battery. 
Nope. Tried moving the laptop to a differnet part of the room where 
there might be less bogon flux. Still not working. Eventually I gave up 
and used the IrDA port instead - which is usually the serial connection 
of doom, grief, and teeth-grinding.

This morning, in the office, the damn thing is working without a hitch.

Anyone like to suggest what mystery technology is in use in the hotel 
that prevents serial ports from working under Linux?

Dan Gillmor: State needs intelligent energy deregulation

By Dan Gillmor
Mercury News Technology Columnist

The facts were trade and government secrets at the time. But the energy
industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify
soaring wholesale electricity and natural-gas prices in California.

Now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial
and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what
everyone suspected. Market games helped engineer the price spikes.

The latest manipulation was highlighted in Monday's finding by a federal
administrative law judge, who said a dominant natural-gas company squeezed
supplies in order to squeeze customers. His ruling came a few days after
California's Public Utilities Commission reported that electricity
generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch,
also driving up prices.

And don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked
the system, in schemes best summed up by an Enron insider's boast in a
memorandum made public in May, that ``Enron gets paid for moving energy to
relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any
congestion.''

How much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be
seen. Unfortunately, California's response -- confusion, lawsuits and
policy tweaks -- hasn't been sufficient.

More unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things --
including a hard-nosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers'
grips -- we would need a willing federal partner. But it's foolish to think
that the Bush administration would do much to help one of its least
favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of
traditional, non-renewable energy sources.

If the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any
fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the
state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. That's a
reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles.

State policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile.
Instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation -- still a good idea if
it gives customers genuine choices -- state laws and regulations ``put the
utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,''
notes V. John White, executive director of the Sacramento-based Center for
Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies (www.ceert.org).

It's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities --
tempting but a bad idea. When there's genuine competition, as we could
achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better
job. Instead of abandoning deregulation, California should find a way to
inject real competition into the market.

We do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity
defies privatization, at least under current conditions. Smart regulation
is essential.

But the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers
control. There are two ways: conservation and replacement. We need more of
both.

The best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up
the use of electricity from renewables. By 2017, California's utilities
will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable
sources. Several power companies are expected to do this even sooner.

But this law has an element of old-line thinking, the captive-customer
model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. Lip service to newer
ideas isn't enough.

The state should be removing barriers to micro-generation systems, small
generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized,
harder-to-disrupt electricity to homes and businesses. This technology is
coming along fast. State policies are not keeping pace.

Investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all.
California should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax
incentives or outright grants in low-income households. California hasn't
done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did
react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's
lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it
altogether.

Maybe this is all pointless. The Bush administration's energy policies, so
grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are
making us all more vulnerable. Never mind what might happen if the coming
war in Iraq goes badly.

It's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy -- a crash program to
drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogen-based energy
system. But the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its
own right, does have some clout. We can hit the rip-off artists where it
hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. Maybe next
year.

New Sequences Window,"Well, I've used the check-the-modify-time cache trick for files in
many places (not just exmh) so some part of me certainly thinks it
is effective.  However, it occurred to me that if we do checkpoint
state, then aren't we modifying the sequences file for the current
folder on every message read?  Perhaps we look at the sequences file
more than once per message view?  Just idle speculation - we can
stick in some time calls to find out how expensive things are.

Someone asked about increasing the time resolution in the exmh log.
We could make that conditional on some support available in 8.3 -
Tcl has had ""clock seconds"" (like gettimeofday) and ""clock clicks""
(high resolution timer) for some time.  But in 8.3 we've calibrated
clock clicks values to microseconds.  It is still only useful for
relative times, but each call to Exmh_Log could emit the microsecond
delta since the last log record.  Of course, we are measuring all
the overhead of taking the log record, etc.  I'll try it out.

An example:  Being able to model RF propagation in three dimensions for a
metro area when deploying wireless networks.  By having every single tree
and building detail and similar, you can ""see"" even tiny dead spots due to
physical blockage and signal attenuation.  Overlay this with fiber map data
for yourself and your competitors (when you can glean such data), which is
also useful at this resolution, and you have a very slick way of modeling
existing network deployments in excruciating detail and optimizing further
deployments to maximize coverage and bandwidth.  Take that and tie it into a
slick geo-physically aware real-time network monitoring and management
system and you've really got something...

For many applications though, 5-meter data is probably adequate.

Don't worry too much : The day the server gets too busy, I'll cleanup and
publish the addresses of some mirrors, as many ftp mirrors exist (I'm aware
of at least 15), and even an apt one :-)
For now, the limit is far enough : When I unlocked the Psyche ISO images on

100Mbps physical NIC! Of course, I'd get in trouble if it was always like
that, but the average used when no new Red Hat release is there is between
2 and 4Mbps, which my company tolerates, as I've convinced them it's a

mbayes] Deployment,"Quite independently from testing and tuning the algorithm, I'd like to
think about deployment.

Eventually, individuals and postmasters should be able to download a
spambayes software distribution, answer a few configuration questions
about their mail setup, training and false positives, and install it
as a filter.

A more modest initial goal might be the production of a tool that can
easily be used by individuals (since we're more likely to find
individuals willing to risk this than postmasters).

There are many ways to do this.  Some ideas:

- A program that acts both as a pop client and a pop server.  You
  configure it by telling it about your real pop servers.  You then
  point your mail reader to the pop server at localhost.  When it
  receives a connection, it connects to the remote pop servers, reads
  your mail, and gives you only the non-spam.  To train it, you'd only
  need to send it the false negatives somehow; it can assume that
  anything is ham that you don't say is spam within 48 hours.

- A server with a custom protocol that you send a copy of a message
  and that answers ""spam"" or ""ham"".  Then you have a little program
  that is invoked e.g. by procmail that talks to the server.  (The
  server exists so that it doesn't have to load the pickle with the
  scoring database for each message.  I don't know how big that pickle
  would be, maybe loading it each time is fine.  Or maybe
  marshalling.)

- Your idea here.

Takers?  How is ESR's bogofilter packaged?  SpamAssassin?  The Perl
Bayes filter advertised on slashdot?

Basically, you somehow evoke the state you want, and when you get it,
you do something odd, anything at all will do, but I used a gentle

This is probably the neuro-effect that leads to performance-enhancing

When I'd read that ""getting legal title
can take 20 years"", when I believe that
1 year ought to be more than sufficient,
(and helped by the Cairo reference) I'd
assumed that we were talking about the
urban poor.

If I see people living in mansions, or
even in suburban subdivisions, I assume
they didn't have too much trouble with
their titles.

If I see people living in shanties and
haphazard alleyways, I tend to assume
their parcels weren't exactly recorded
on the government maps, or paid for with
a bank loan, especially when nearby vacant
lots have shotgun wielding men presumably
intent on keeping them ""development"" free.

Now, it may be that ""Manhattanites' view
of America"" to say that outside of Metro
Manila, Davao, and maybe another city or
two (Cebu?), everything else (literally)
is the boondocks.  But going on that very
broad assumption, I guess I'm describing
the flip side of Mr. Roger's experience:
the paisanos (who leave behind those who
remain on a patron's rural land) move to
Manila, and (the second assumption) squat
in shantytowns there, at least until they
can line up a middle-class job.

So, going on two large assumptions, I can
come up with a scenario under which title
would take 20 years: a shantytown arises
somewhere in the midst of a section (or
whatever the Spanish used to divvy up the
land) and it takes decades of arguing to
put together a package which somehow can
both compensate the owner and record lots
for the inhabitants.  Just transferring
title to an existing lot, between parties
who have money, ought not to be a problem.

The obvious solution, at least to us
barking farting chihuahuas on FoRK, is
to ""introduce market mechanisms"".  It is
left as an exercise to come up with one
which works when many of the agents (are
perceived to) have negligible NPV.

"use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from a
    ttacks","I did something crudely along those lines for VMS VAX maybe 13 years
ago; there is at least one product that does it for PC though I don't
recall its name. It is also handy for cases where you have a CD image
of some filesystem (or some other image of a filesystem) that is
intrinsically readonly but whose filesystem will not accept (or is
not graceful) readonly storage. It is also more or less necessary
if you want to work with WORM file structures, which are older still.
There have been a number of filesystems for those dating back to the
early 1980s if not before.

A generic facility of the type you mention is also one way to implement
snapshots on top of an existing filesystem. The written information
must (obviously!) be seekable so you can provide the illusion that you
wrote to the storage. A device level implementation is however perfectly
adequate.

It does not, of course, distinguish for you what should have been changed
and what should not. If you truly know a device (or perhaps a partition)
must not be written, it can be simpler to either return error on writes,
or to just return a fake success on writes yet discard the data. (NTFS
lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. I have not
tried it on extf3 or reiser.) 

BTW, think about your mention of RAID and consider the complexity of
writing to RAID4 or RAID5...
I would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense
to use RAID, save for shadowing and possibly striping. Those at least do
not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher RAID levels have, and
there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk
may hold 200 gigs and up. Why not dedicate another whole disk to fault
recovery
and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of RAID?

Subject: use of base image / delta image for automated recovery from
attacks


Hi,

I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.

This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html

Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.

The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.

When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)

Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.

Thanks for any opinions,
Ben

""rpm http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/ redhat/8.0 task"" to your sources.list 
and after apt-get update you can find out what's available with 
'apt-cache search ^task-'

These are generated directly from comps.xml of RH8.0 so they contain 
exactly the same packages as you'll get by choosing the various categories 
at install time. I didn't bother including SRPMS for these as they are 
rather uninteresting, if you want you can re-generate the .specs by 
running http://koti.welho.com/pmatilai/comps2task/comps2task.py.

BTW the repository only contains the task-packages, you'll need an

   shape, or form when running over a public corpus.

2. These messages could also be submitted (more than once) to projects
   like SpamAssassin that rely on filtering results submission for GA
   tuning and development.

3. Spammers could adopt elements of the good messages to throw off
   filters.  And, of course, there's always progression in technology
   (by both spammers and non-spammers).

The second problem could be alleviated somewhat by adding a Nilsimsa
signature (or similar) to the mass-check file (the results format used
by SpamAssassin) and giving the message files unique names (MD5 or
SHA-1 of each file).

The third problem doesn't really worry me.

These problems (and perhaps others I have not identified) are unique
to spam filtering.  Compression corpuses and other performance-related
corpuses have their own set of problems, of course.

In other words, I don't think there's any replacement for having
multiple independent corpuses.  Finding better ways to distribute
testing and collate results seems like a more viable long-term solution
(and I'm glad we're working on exactly that for SpamAssassin).  If
you're going to seriously work on filter development, building a corpus
of 10000-50000 messages (half spam/half non-spam) is not really that
much work.  If you don't get enough spam, creating multi-technique
spamtraps (web, usenet, replying to spam) is pretty easy.  And who
doesn't get thousands of non-spam every week?  ;-)

CO2 and climate (was RE: Goodbye Global Warming),"OK, let's bring some data into the discussion:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/02.htm
(A graph, derived from Vostok ice core samples, of CO2 and temperature
fluctuations over the past 400k years).

Based on the Vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation
between temperature and CO2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to
be causal.

Also correct -- the peak of each cycle is at about 290-300 ppm CO2.

Not correct. Mauna Loa data <http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/06.htm> and
<http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ftp/ndp001/maunaloa.co2> show that the current CO2
concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% *greater* than the *highest* recorded
value from the past 400k years. Furthermore, CO2 concentrations are growing
at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the
Vostok data (though perhaps the Vostok data isn't capable of such fine
resolution).

> In other words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels,

No, we are *definitely* adding to CO2 levels. Look at the following chart:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/07.htm
(Shows CO2 concentrations since 1870, the ""historical record"").

Not only is the CO2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the Vostok
record, it is clear that the rate of change is *increasing*, not decreasing.
There is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for
anthropogenic input. You're really out on the fringe if you're debating
this -- even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.

Wrong again. Current CO2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past
400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows CO2 levels to quickly
spike, and then return back to ""normal"" background levels (and hence the
spike might not show up in the ice cores).

Still, by around 2075-2100 we will have reached 500 ppm CO2, a level that
even you would have a hard time arguing away.

Yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. Still, we know ocean water has a
finite capacity to store CO2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase,
but we all have Seattle-like weather all the time, the effects would be
enormous.

Correct.

Data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses:
http://www.grida.no/climate/vital/05.htm

Note that methane concentrations now are *much* higher than pre-industrial
levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also
a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. Another clearly
anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. I'm in favor of reductions in
methane levels as well.

I tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in
reducing global warming. I favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar,
wind and nuclear, with all carbon-based combustion using renewable sources
of C-H bonds. Aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense
(burying trees deep underground, for example). Approaches that involve
reductions in lifestyle to a ""sustainable"" level are unrealistic --
Americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate
change researchers driving SUVs). But, as California showed during last
year's energy crisis, shifts in patterns of consumption are possible, and
improved efficiency is an easy sell.

I tried the ""Anthony"" stuff, but it didn't make any appreciable
difference that I could see from staring at the false negative rate.
The numbers are big enough that a quick eyeball suffices.

Then I tried a dirt simple tokenizer for the headers that tokenize the
words in the header and emitted like this ""%s: %s"" % (hdr, word).
That worked too well :-).  The received and date headers helped the
classifier discover that most of my spam is old and most of my ham is
new.

So I tried a slightly more complex one that skipped received, data,
and x-from_, which all contained timestamps.  I also skipped the X-VM-
headers that my mail reader added:

class MyTokenizer(Tokenizer):

    skip = {'received': 1,
            'date': 1,
            'x-from_': 1,
            }

    def tokenize_headers(self, msg):
        for k, v in msg.items():
            k = k.lower()
            if k in self.skip or k.startswith('x-vm'):
                continue
            for w in subject_word_re.findall(v):
                for t in tokenize_word(w):
                    yield ""%s:%s"" % (k, t)

This did moderately better.  The false negative rate is 7-21% over the
tests performed so far.  This is versus 11-28% for the previous test
run that used the timtest header tokenizer.

It's interesting to see that the best descriminators are all ham
discriminators.  There's not a single spam-indicator in the list.
Most of the discriminators are header fields.  One thing to note is
that the presence of Mailman-generated headers is a strong non-spam
indicator.  That matches my intuition: I got an awful lot of
Mailman-generated mail, and those lists are pretty good at surpressing
spam.  The other thing is that I get a lot of ham from people who use
XEmacs.  That's probably Barry, Guido, Fred, and me :-).

One final note.  It looks like many of the false positives are from
people I've never met with questions about Shakespeare.  They often
start with stuff like:

Lennon killer seeks parole again

The man who shot dead former Beatle John Lennon is making another bid for
early release from prison - the day before what would have been Lennon's
62nd birthday.
Mark David Chapman, 47, was jailed for life after he admitted killing the
superstar outside his New York apartment building in 1980.
It is the second time in two years that Chapman has sought parole from
Attica state prison.
At a 2000 hearing, he argued that he was no longer a danger to society and
had overcome the psychological problems which led him to shoot the
ex-Beatle.
Chapman had said that a voice in his head told him to shoot the star.
Shot dead
Lennon was shot four times as he emerged from a limousine outside his New
York City apartment on 8 December 1980.
He and his wife Yoko Ono were returning from a late-night recording session
during which time they had been working on Walking on Thin Ice.
Only hours before the shooting, Chapman - who had come to New York from
Hawaii - was photographed with the singer outside the same building as
Lennon signed a copy of his album Double Fantasy for him.
The killer said Lennon had been just ""a picture on an album cover"" to him
before the shooting.
'Deserved death'
Chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his
crime.
Lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if
Chapman were released.
Lennon's songwriting partnership with Paul McCartney propelled the
Liverpool-based pop group to international stardom and unparalleled
commercial success.
The Beatles front man, peace campaigner, and all-round iconoclast, would
have been 62 on Wednesday.

By ""meanings have evolved"" do you [or they] mean that the Hebrew words

changed? Or do they posit a pre-Mosaic form of the laws that had
evolved by time of the Pentateuch?

This seems bogus to me. A quick check of the text indicates the the
Hebrew word in question is GANAV which elsewhere in the Pentateuch (eg
Gen 44.8) is used to mean steal silver and gold amongst other things.

In July 1999, I made the following comment in response to a similar
claim about the ""real"" meaning of one of the ten commandments:

""""""

We have the original language versions, though, so this is not an

This has nothing to do with successive translations. It is based on our
knowledge of the meaning of the Hebrew word ""ratsach"". Most modern
translations I've seen translate it ""murder"" but elsewhere the word is
used
of an animal killing a human (something for which most English speakers
wouldn't use the word ""murder"").

Yeah, assuming approximately equal populations.
But that obscures the different modes of
promiscuity. Both the person who gives sex for
money or power or companionship and the person
who uses money and power and companionship to
get sex are promiscuous, in the broadest sense
of the word. But their motives and behavior are
quite different.

Langur monkeys were the example in the cited
article. ""Dominant males .. kill babies that
are not their own."" ""The dominant male monkey
.. seeks to defend his harem of females."" But
cozying up to the current dominant male isn't
the best strategy for female langurs, because
""dominant males are dethroned by rivals every
27 months or so."" ""By mating with as many
extra-group males as possible, female langurs
ensure their offspring against infanticide,""
by the male who is likely next to rule the
roost.

Maybe it's just me, but that doesn't paint a
picture of carefree females engaged in joyously
promiscuous couplings. The dom cab driver who
is taking her two boy toys to New Orleans is a
better picture of that. ;-)

You're not dense. I'm going to zero the habeas scores on my copy of
SpamAssassin. I think they were added to SA quite prematurely. To me it's
simple:

1. People who send me legitimate email have absolutely no motivation to use
Habeas, at least until it gets lots more press, and even then only
bulk-mailing companies like Amazon or eBay are going to bother, and I
already whitelist them. Individuals won't bother.

2. Spammers have lots of motivation to forge the Habeas headers, and a good
percentage of them are completely out of the legal reach of Habeas.

I think it should be subjected to the same testing and scrutiny as any other
potential new rule. When I test against my corpus here's what I get:

Date: 2002-09-04T02:10:04+01:00

With project budgets in the multiple millions of dollars and virtually no 
margin for error, more and more development teams are under tremendous pressure 
to come out on top of the entertainment software market's cutthroat 
competition. No team manager wants to contemplate dropping the ball when 
creating the vivid graphics necessary to help make a game a success. Electronic 
Arts' The Sims franchise is an excellent example of this pressurized situation. 
This article highlights the critical issues that govern the high volume asset 
production needed for today's most demanding games.

Although my fingerprints are all over that, it's not actually my code and has 
been in there since before 1998.  (It's code that I moved from mh.tcl to 
sequences.tcl and back again).  I'm no5 sure either, but it should be a 
one-time penalty because the sequence will be re-written with the bad messages 
removed.  (I think.)

That *was* a problem, but if you look at Mh_Sequence (and Mh_Sequences and 
Mh_SequenceUpdate), they all call MhReadSeqs to do the actual reading and it 
only reads the sequences if the file has been touched.  Look for the 
""Exmh_Debug Reading $filename"" output in the debug log to see when sequences 
are actually reread from disk.


My theory is that Ftoc_ShowSequences is being called too often.  I'm about to 
investigate that.

cs Journal interviews Ted Rall,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85516563
Date: Not supplied

Interview with cartoonist Ted Rall, who has traveled to South Asia recently, 
and has tips on how to deal with bribe-hungry border guards and the like: 

    Rall: Now I realize that's just the way it is, and I know how to do it and 
    get away without paying a bribe, or paying something very modest. You have 
    to show them that you know the routine and that you know you don't have to 
    give them anything, and just have a low-key demeanor. But if you get angry, 
    that's just going to make things worse for you. You get out of your vehicle 
    and you walk up to them -- you don't try to avoid these guys; you don't try 
    to avoid their eyes -- you go up with a big smile, give them a big 
    handshake and sort of rub their shoulders and say, ""Hey, great to see you. 
    You're my new best friend for the next five minutes."" 

    GROTH: Basically act like a used car salesman. 

    RALL: It's exactly like that! You always carry cigarettes. You offer them a 
    cigarette, and you say, ""Hey, what's goin' on? How's it goin'? Great. 
    Here's my documents. How's the road?"" Just small talk, because these guys 
    are bored. They're in the middle of nowhere, and you're sometimes the only 
    vehicle they've seen for many hours. They're often very drunk, so you just 
    have to be cool.

 Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Thugs of South Boston and The Revenge of the Bandit Princess


The Geodesic Economy
Robert A. Hettinga
Sunday, August 25, 2002

(BOSTON) When you think about it one way, the FBI/Winter Hill vs.
Patriarcha/Angiulo Cosa Nostra fight was just another race war
between thugs.

Put crudely, and at its most racist, the FBI and the Winter Hill Gang
were the (mostly) Irish thugs, and Patriarcha's ""family"" were, of
course, the (mostly) Italian thugs.


Think Scorsese's upcoming ""Gangs of New York"", only with
counter-reformatory overtones. Hoover's South Boston ""social-club""
putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in
hindsight. The U.S. Federal Government actually decided to underwrite
a reversal of the prohibition-era capture of the nation's rackets by
the Italians from the Irish. The fact that the plot was hatched not
for New York, but for South Boston, the most Irish place in the US,
only makes even more gigantic the Big Lie that was told by the FBI to
its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime
there once and for all.

The result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of
Italian Boston mob violence for Irish methadone. Hoover was,
posthumously, swapping it for Oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine
- -- or, more properly, PCP. The absolute psychopathology of violence
in Whitey Bulger's crack-cocaine-era reign of Boston's drug markets,
like the identical FBI-sponsored reigns or violent horror by other
also-rans in cities across the US as a whole, went up whole orders of
magnitude, not mere percentage points.

As Stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. And, make
no mistake, J. Edgar Hoover was directly responsible that ""quality""
of carnage, nation-wide.


So, yes, on paper at least, it really *was* just the swapping of one
gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at
least, business as usual. Same stuff, different century, with
apparently decent people like Mr. Salvati et.al accidently ground on
the gears of ""justice"" like so much hamburger.

However, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was
""greasing"", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could
love: a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence --
on paper, if nowhere else -- by government fiat and the, back-door,
but still elitist, will to power of H.L. Mencken's famous ""bluenoses
and busybodies"".


It all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of
beginnings. What she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling Mrs. Grundy
then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a
smaller, ""manageable"" demand. The bloody result was, like nine more
heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition,
in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on.

Every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or
harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic -- or, now,
apparently, fattening -- and then prohibited, exactly the same thing
happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the Volstead
years. A *larger* market than before the prohibition. Hugely
lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently
scale newly-legislated ""barriers to competition"" imposed on them by
the state. Increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of
those substances. And, finally, the ultimate in evil -- the kind of
evil this country actually fought wars to end -- increasingly
coercive axe-handle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred
liberty of the average, but now unavoidably-law-breaking, citizenry.

As Ayn Rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need
government if nobody's breaking the law. In some twisted corollary to
Parkinson's Law, governments, to survive, *need* more people,
breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they
confiscate at tax time.

And, to bring us back to the point, David Friedman would probably
echo here his father Milton's famous observation that government
regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and
never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. Even,
*especially*, if those sellers are *breaking* the law, as they are in
the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our
government now imposes on us.


And there, absent the apparent grace of Mr. Hoover, went Mr. Salvati.

In fact, Hayek himself, in ""The Road to Serfdom"", couldn't have
predicted any better the gory consequences of Hoover's blatant
imposition, ""for our own good"", of Vietnam-era statist power at the
neighborhood level. And, furthermore, *Stalin* couldn't have had
better ""useful idiots"" than Hoover did -- and neither, by an
absolutely literal extension, did Whitey Bulger after Hoover.

Useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. Idiots who
were eating out of Hoover's power-craven hand for the entire middle
of the 20th century -- and Whitey Bulger's hand, whether they knew it
or not, until the end of the millennium. A time, you'll notice, which
saw the increasingly steady imposition of ""mob"" violence, and market
control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the
imaginings of even the most power-mad, rum-running, stock-kiting,
movie-flopping, bureau-pumping, Nazi-appeasing Irish-Bostonian Little
Caesar. Or, as for that matter, his safely trust-funded, and now
strictly political, descendents.

In terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to Mr.
Salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a ""transfer-price"", in
human lives, of the inevitable consequence of MacNamara-style
Vietnam-era Keynesian ""social-cost"" input-output accounting at its
most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that
was committed by Hoover, and his co-religionists in state economic
control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a
race war between thugs up in Boston.


This shouldn't be a surprise, really. All race wars are at least
fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and
endorsed, at the time, by all the ""right"" people, for all the ""right""
reasons.

As far as the FBI itself goes, remember Mancur Olson's observation
that a ""prince"" is just a stationary bandit.

Though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and,
what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of
people of his own affectional preference, I suppose we can call J.
Edgar Hoover a bandit ""princess"", instead.

""Bandit Queen"", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens --
and real bandits -- everywhere.

Hoover's F.B.I. and the Mafia: Case of Bad Bedfellows Grows By FOX
BUTTERFIELD

BOSTON, Aug. 24 - It was March 1965, in the early days of J. Edgar
Hoover's war against the Mafia. F.B.I. agents, say Congressional
investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of
New England's organized-crime boss, Raymond Patriarca.

Two gangsters, Joseph Barboza and Vincent Flemmi, wanted Mr.
Patriarca's permission to kill a small-time hoodlum, Edward Deegan,
""as they were having a problem with him,"" according to an F.B.I. log
of the conversation. ""Patriarca ultimately furnished this O.K.,"" the
F.B.I. reported, and three days later Mr. Deegan turned up dead in an
alley, shot six times.

It was an extraordinary situation: The Federal Bureau of
Investigation had evidence ahead of time that two well-known
gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the New England
Mafia was involved.

But when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real
killers - who also happened to be informers for the F.B.I. - were
left alone. Four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to
death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing
to do with it.

One, Joseph Salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with
the Justice Department last week that he planned to sue the F.B.I.
for $300 million for false imprisonment.

His is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the F.B.I., the
Justice Department and some F.B.I. agents growing out of the tangled,
corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the F.B.I.'s Boston
office in its effort to bring down the mob.

The lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years
in a judicial hearing and a Justice Department inquiry. But some of
the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light,
including documents detailing conversation in which Mr. Patriarca
approved the murder. They were released as part of an investigation
by the House Committee on Government Reform, which has pressured the
department into turning over records about the F.B.I in Boston.

The documents show that officials at F.B.I. headquarters, apparently
including Mr. Hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that Boston agents
were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were
protecting them from prosecution.

""J. Edgar Hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal
himself,"" said Vincent Garo, Mr. Salvati's lawyer. ""He allowed a
witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect
one of his informants.""

Mr. Barboza was a crucial witness at trial against Mr. Salvati and
may have implicated him because Mr. Salvati owed $400 to a loan shark
who worked for Mr. Barboza.

Asked about the documents showing that Mr. Hoover knew of Mr.
Salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, Gail Marcinkiewicz, a
spokeswoman for the F.B.I. in Boston, declined to comment, citing the
pending litigation.

A Justice Department task force is continuing to investigate
misconduct in the Boston office. In one of the first results of the
investigation, one retired agent, John J. Connolly, is awaiting
sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and
obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were
F.B.I. informers, James Bulger and Stephen Flemmi. Vincent and
Stephen Flemmi are brothers.

The Government Reform Committee, led by Representative Dan Burton,
Republican of Indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the Boston
office to headquarters in Washington revealing the bureau's knowledge
that Vincent Flemmi and Mr. Barboza were involved in killing Mr.
Deegan. A memorandum a week after the killing described the crime,
including who fired the first shot.

Then, on June 4, 1965, Mr. Hoover's office demanded to know what
progress was being made in developing Vincent Flemmi as an informer.

In a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the Boston
office said that Mr. Flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot
wounds but because of his connections to Mr. Patriarca ""potentially
could be an excellent informant.""

The agent also informed Mr. Hoover that Mr. Flemmi was known to have
killed seven men, ""and, from all indications, he is going to continue
to commit murder."" Nevertheless, the agent said, ""the informant's
potential outweighs the risk involved.""

A Congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. ""The most
frightening part is that after being warned about Flemmi's murders,
the director does not even respond,"" the investigator said. ""There is
no message not to use a murderer as a government informant.""

The origin of the corruption scandal was public and political
pressure on Mr. Hoover to move more forcefully against the growing
power of the Mafia, which he had largely ignored. In Boston, F.B.I.
agents recruited Mr. Barboza and Mr. Flemmi and developed close ties
to a rival criminal organization, the Winter Hill Gang, led by Mr.
Bulger.

Both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and
the trial of Mr. Connolly. The F.B.I. got information that eventually
helped destroy the Patriarca and Angiulo families, which controlled
organized crime in New England. Mr. Bulger's gang was able to take
over the rackets in Boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while
the F.B.I. looked the other way.

One reason the F.B.I. may not have used its information about Mr.
Patriarca's involvement in the Deegan murder, Congressional
investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device
in his Providence, R.I., headquarters. The F.B.I. agent who
transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was
coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device,
the investigators say.

Mr. Salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted
in 1997 by Gov. William F. Weld. Last year, while he was still on
parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a Massachusetts state
judge after the Justice Department task force made public documents
suggesting his innocence.

Two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. Their
survivors have joined the fourth man, Peter Limone, in a $375 million
lawsuit against the Justice Department. Mr. Limone was sentenced to
die in the electric chair. His life was spared only when
Massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974.

Mr. Salvati lives in a modest apartment in Boston's North End with
his wife, Marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30
years. Each week Mr. Salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put
on the television set. It was, Mr. Garo said, all they had of each
other.

Sure!  I think it's relevant, but maybe for another purpose.  Paul Svensson
is thinking harder about real people <wink> than the rest of us, and he may
be able to get use out of approaches that identify closely related spam.
For example, some amount of spam is going to end up in the ham training data

        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com


The current FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS triggers on any from where the user name ends
in two or more digits.  I think this should be split up into different
numbers of trailing digits, so that rules with different S/O ratios can
get different scores.  So I've made test rules that look from From
names that end with two, three, four, or five digitis, and one for six or
more digitis; I also put in a test rule that looks for Froms that end in a
single digit, just the sake of completeness.

Here is what I got:

I should note that I get rather bad S/O's for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS, probably
because so much of my corpus is made up of Yahoo! Groups traffic, which
seems to have a lot of users that like sticking numbers at the ends of their
names.  Here is the normal stats for FROM_ENDS_IN_NUMS:

So, d'ya remember that whole CSS debate that flared up about six months ago? 
(Actually, it flares up continuously in various circles. In fact, I think it's 
about time for it to flare up again in weblogging circles. These things are 
inexorably cyclical. CSS-vs-tables is the hemorrhoid of the web design world. 
But I digress.) 

If you were around back then, you will no doubt recall that I was in the 
pro-CSS camp[1]. 

So anyway, d'ya remember that argument that went something like &#8220;you 
should design with web standards and CSS because it will future-proof your site 
for the pie-in-the-sky future when people surf the web on mobile 
devices&#8221;? Well, it's crap[2]. 

There are lots of good arguments for designing with web standards and CSS: 
automatically print-friendly pages[3], dynamic style switchers[4], reduced 
bandwidth[5], and aiding and abetting accessibility[6] (a topic which I claim 
to know a lot about[7]), among others. But &#8220;because it'll future-proof 
your site for the next generation of mobile devices&#8221; is not one of them. 
The theory is solid, but apparently nobody told the makers of the mobile 
devices (now that we have them) how it was all supposed to work in practice. 
Oops.

This was poking fun of the practice of making
up differnt types of speech with different
types of protected status.  I think the
laws specialing out hate and protected speech
are ridiculous.  The point I keep trying to make
is that there's only two types, speech and action. 
I agree, they are all speech and should be 
covered by the First Amendment, but

If hate speech is so protected, why are certain
states trying to prosecute people for it?  There's
only two answers and one of them is wrong.

  1) Because hate speech is different and needs to
     have a different level of protection dictated
     by whoever's offended at the time.
  2) It's because it's not just speech, but action.
     A action who's consequences are foreseeable by 
     any reasonable person. 

Hate speech is mislabeled.  It's really ""threat"".  I think
they let the mislabeling perpetuate as there's advantage
in being able to counter-threat with loss of liberty and
money through civil and criminal lawsuits for people THEY
don't like.

I believe that's just a matter of string parsing. If someone were to fix
the openssh package, removing the explicit Requires:, I believe the
automagic binary handler would figure the right libraries to use and
install. I haven't met an openssh like that and in worst case I've had 3

I have a few such things (with jdk, imlib, kernel DRI version..

zteana] Nobel astrophysicists,"Nobel Honors 3 for Astrophysics Work 

Tuesday October 8, 2002 12:00 PM
STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) - Two Americans and a Japanese won the Nobel Prize in
physics Tuesday for using some of the most obscure particles and waves in
nature to understand the workings of astronomy's grandest wonders.
Riccardo Giacconi, 71, of the Associated Universities Inc. in Washington,
D.C., will get half of the $1 million prize for his role in ``pioneering
contributions to astrophysics, which have led to the discovery of cosmic
X-ray sources.''
Raymond Davis, Jr., 87, of the University of Pennsylvania shares the other
half of the prize with Japanese scientist Masatoshi Koshiba, 76, of the
University of Tokyo. The two men pioneered the construction of giant
underground chambers to detect neutrinos, elusive particles that stream from
the sun by the billion.
Neutrinos offer an unparalleled view of the sun's inner workings because
they are produced in its heart by the same process that causes it to shine.
In fact, Davis' early experiments, performed during the 1960s in a South
Dakota gold mine, confirmed that the sun is powered by nuclear fusion.
Koshiba won his share of the prize for his work at the Kamiokande neutrino
detector in Japan. That experiment confirmed and extended Davis' work, and
also discovered neutrinos coming from distant supernova explosions, some of
the brightest objects in the universe.
The Italian-born Giacconi, a U.S. citizen, was awarded half of the prize for
building the first X-ray telescopes that provided ``completely new - and
sharp - images of the universe,'' the academy said.
His research laid the foundation for X-ray astronomy, which has led to the
discovery of black holes and allowed researchers to peer deep into the
hearts of the dusty young galaxies where stars are born.
When academy officials reached Giacconi by phone at his home outside
Washington, he said he was ``dumbstruck'' to learn of the prize. Koshiba
also was phoned at home in Tokyo, but the academy was still trying to reach
Davis, spokesman Erling Norrby said.
This year's Nobel awards started Monday with the naming of Britons Sydney
Brenner, 75, and Sir John E. Sulston, 60, and American H. Robert Horvitz,
55, as winners of the medicine prize, selected by a committee at the
Karolinska Institute.
The researchers shared it for discoveries about how genes regulate organ
growth and a process of programmed cell deaths that shed light on how
viruses and bacteria invade human cells, including in conditions such as
AIDS, strokes, cancer and heart attacks.
The winner of the Nobel Prize in chemistry will be named on Wednesday
morning and the Bank of Sweden Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of
Alfred Nobel later the same day.
The literature prize winner will be announced on Thursday, the Swedish
Academy said on Tuesday.
The winner of the coveted peace prize - the only one not awarded in Sweden -
will be announced Friday in Oslo, Norway.
The award committees make their decisions in deep secrecy and candidates are
not publicly revealed for 50 years.
Alfred Nobel, the wealthy Swedish industrialist and inventor of dynamite who
endowed the prizes left only vague guidelines for the selection committees.
In his will he said the prize being revealed on Tuesday should be given to
those who ``shall have conferred the greatest benefit on mankind'' and
``shall have made the most important discovery or invention within the field
of physics.''
The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which also chooses the chemistry and
economics winners, invited nominations from previous recipients and experts
in the fields before cutting down its choices. Deliberations are conducted
in strict secrecy.
The prizes are presented on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in
1896, in Stockholm and in Oslo.

What, are they illiterate? Mute? What's their problem? If somebody stops
them from posting web pages, or printing newsletters, or talking on the

om hack Q: drawing on CDs with lasers?,"O utensils of the world --

I wonder if it is possible to reverse-engineer the Reed-Solomon 
error-correcting codes to create a bytestream such that, when burned 
onto a CD, you can make out a picture in the diffraction pattern?

I suppose this is a modern equivalent to line-printer artwork; I was 
imagining using a CD-RW drive to use the outer track, say, to spell out 
the disc title, creation time, etc. It would sure beat feeding CDs 
through a laser printer :-)

A Mother had 3 virgin daughters. They were all getting married within a 
short time period. Because Mom was a bit worried about how their sex 
life would get started, she made them all promise to send a postcard 
from the honeymoon with a few words on how marital sex felt. 

The first girl sent a card from Hawaii two days after the wedding.  The 
card said nothing but ""Maxwell House"".  Mom was puzzled at first, but 
then went to the kitchen and got out the Nescafe jar. It said: ""Good till 
the last drop."" Mom blushed, but was pleased for her daughter. 

The second girl sent the card from Vermont a week after the wedding, 
and the card read: ""Benson & Hedges"".  Mom now knew to go straight to 
her husband's cigarettes, and she read from the Benson & Hedges pack: 
""Extra Long, King Size"".  She was again slightly embarrassed but still 
happy for her daughter. 

The third girl left for her honeymoon in the Caribbean.  Mom waited for 
a week, nothing. Another week went by and still nothing.  Then after a 
whole month, a card finally arrived.  Written on it with shaky 
handwriting were the words: ""British Airways"".  Mom took out her latest 
Harper's Bazaar magazine, flipped through the pages fearing the worst, 
and finally found the ad for the airline.  The ad said: ""Three times a 
day, seven days a week, both ways."" 

Mom fainted.

What do you mean by ""CD-Key or the like"" (I presume that ""of"" was a
typo)? And what do you mean by ""unbreakable""?

You need to be far more explicit about the problem which you wish to
solve, and about the constraints involved.

Some general points:

1. For a conventional ""CD key"" system, where the actual CDs are
mass-produced (where you have many identical CDs), and the entire
system has to work offline, you cannot solve the problem of valid keys
being ""traded"" (e.g. included along with bootleg copies of the
product).

If there's an online element involved, you can ""tie"" keys to a
specific hardware configuration, as is done (AFAIK) for Windows XP's
""product activation"".

2. Anything which uses a symmetric cipher (or hash) is bound to be
vulnerable to reverse engineering of the validation routines within
the executable.

3. Ultimately, any software mechanism will be vulnerable to
""cracking"", i.e. modifying the software to disable or circumvent the
validation checks.

This can only be prevented by the use of trusted hardware (e.g. a
Palladium-style system).

Most significantly, the data must be supplied in a form which is only
accessible by that hardware. If anyone can get at the data in a
meaningful (i.e. unencrypted) form, they can extract the useful parts
and discard the rest (i.e. any associated protection mechanisms).

IOW, you have to ""keep the genie in the bottle"" at all times. If the
data can be got at just once (even if it requires the use of dedicated
hardware such as a bus analyser), it can then be duplicated and
distributed without limit.

Well, I think my avifile build still needs the win32 codecs to be able to
run (manually copied into /usr/lib/win32/), but personally, I've been very
happy with mplayer's default (which is ffmpeg's ffdivx decoder) for nearly
all the DivX files I used. The only ones that still require (from my own
experience) the use of the win32 codecs are the ones encoded with a strange
DivX 3 sound format... and I've really not seen any quality or speed
improvements when using them.

No, really. My sinus infection, which appeared to be gone, flared up again over 
the weekend in the nastiest way, and I am now coughing up dark mucus and doing 
other things that probably don't bear repeating in a public forum. I have the 
10:15 doctor's appointment that I should have made last round, had I not 
convinced myself that &#8220;it's not that bad&#8221; and trudged through it 
all without prescription drugs. I'm not making the same mistake this time. I'll 
be back this afternoon. 

My email problems of yesterday have been resolved. You can once again reach me 
at my normal address, f8dy@diveintomark.org. 

Kevin Burton[1] emailed me with another way to link to a FOAF file from my RSS 
feed. It looks easier than previous suggestions, and it has the advantage of 
being able to use it from an RSS 1.0 or 2.0 feed, but I worry about all these 
variations. Just as in real life, where people can use different words that 
mean essentially the same thing, in the Semantic Web programs can use different 
vocabularies to express the same statements. That's great for producers, not so 
great for consumers who have to make sense of it all. 

For each domain (RSS feeds, FOAF files, whatever), somebody (or some group) 
needs to come along and document best practices. We need better _goal-oriented_ 
documentation. We have a lot of reference documentation, task-oriented 
documentation, but very little that documents that larger picture and answers 
questions written in English. &#8220;How do I include personal information in 
my RSS feed?&#8221; is a goal-oriented question. &#8220;Create a FOAF file 
using this tool and then insert this line at this location in your RSS 
feed&#8221; (with as many examples as necessary) is a goal-oriented answer. 
Anything less is like trying to master a foreign language by reading a 
dictionary.

Seriously though (or not, as the case may be), The Amazing Spiderman had 
many other abilities to help him out. Most notable, perhaps, was his 
'spidey strength' and 'spidey senses'. The strength to weight ratio of a 
spider is so high that Spiderman is able to throw a bus several city 
blocks with little effort. His endurance is similarly enhanced as well.

As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK not 
really well explained in the comic series. Spiders have multiple eyes, 
ears, noses and tongues which Peter Parker did not visibly have. There 
have been a few attempts to explain his heightened reflexes, from the 
biological to hidden methamphetamine use, but none seem to do the spidey 
sense justice... I seem to recall Spiderman being able to detect the 
presence of well concealed weapons and even sense evil-doers while they 
were in their street clothes. Perhaps the spidey senses are the result 
of some sort of quantum entanglement?

I'm told that even our best people occasionally screw up. And QA had
tested the rpm on an ""Everything"" install. Expect a fixed version soon,
and QA procedures have been adjusted to catch this kind of braindamage
in the future. There is nothing really wrong with the binary inside the

The best I can think of is to figure out what the command being

[ILUG] Serial number in hosts file,"
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

Your actual serial number is 1519761310 - from a dig I've just done.

Try resetting the zone number to 2002082901 - some of your secondaries seem 
to have a serial number below that, so they clearly regard 1519761310 as 
being less than 2002082601.

That should enable them to pick up the new zonefile.

Hi, 
   I am wondering if there are any techniques to make a CD-Key of the like 
unbreakable.  Either by giving it a cancelation date and a periodic renewal 
from a server or just by using self md5 signature on the resulting 
executable.  I know it must not be easy because the whole software piracy 
problem would be resolved but there must be some way to make it really hard 
to break it.  Anyone have hints on this issue ?

Which is to say, if you reduce the argument to absurdity, that law causes 
crime. 

(Yes, I agree that badly written law can make life so frustrating that people 
have little choice but to subvery it if they want to get anything done. This 
is also true of corporate policies, and all other attempts to regulate 
conduct by rules. Rules just don't work well when situations are fluid or 
ambiguous. But I don't think that the misbehavior of energy companies in 
California can properly be called well-intentioned lawbreaking by parties who 
were trying to do the right thing but could do so only by falling afoul of 
some technicality.)

If you want to get to root causes, we should probably go to the slaying of 
Abel by Cain. Perhaps we can figure out what went wrong then, and roll our

OK, so, you get the XML toss it through hardware and turn it back into a
struct/object whatever you call your binary data. I agree this is the way
things will go, as XML parsing has just too much overhead to survive in the

GOv gets tough on Net Users.....er Pirates..,"from http://www.arstechnica.com/

""There has mostly been talk thus far and little action, but the Department
of Justice says it may be ready to file criminal lawsuits against
individuals [1] who distribute or receive unauthorized copyrighted
material over the Internet. Deputy Assistant Attorney General John Malcolm believes
that ""criminal prosecutions of copyright offenders are now necessary to
preserve the viability of America's content industries."" Malcolm also
believes that people who trade copyrighted material think they are
participating in a legal activity. I certainly think people who download
copyrighted works understand that such distribution--barring provisions
such as fair use--is not authorized, and it is not surprising to see
businesses continue to look for means to discourage distribution of
copyrighted works.


""Some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...I think
they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal
prosecution,"" said [RIAA President Cary] Sherman, who was on the same
conference panel.

I'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect Sherman is
hoping for. Although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or
warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor
deterrents to the file-sharing community at large. Criminal lawsuits
carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate
further animosity against groups such as the RIAA and may be difficult to
initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems
participating in file sharing. Only servers would seem to stand out from
the crowd.

The article cites the No Electronic Theft (NET) Act [2], which defines
illegal  activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement:


Criminal infringement: Any person who infringes a copyright willfully for
purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the
reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any
180-day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more
copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000....
For purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution
of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish
willful infringement.
...
The term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of
anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works.


Therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain""
even if no money is involved. The NET Act excerpt does not clarify how the
value of a work is determined; an album or movie could be worth only $15
to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the
perspective of the consumer or copyright holder.

The statute of limitations:


507. Limitations on actions

(a) Criminal Proceedings.--No criminal proceeding shall be maintained
under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five
years after the cause of action arose.

(b) Civil Actions.--No civil action shall be maintained under the
provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after
the claim accrued.

The penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in
Section 2319: Criminal infringement of a copyright. In general, first-time
criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year.

I'm still not sure where the DOJ would start in choosing people to
prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess
would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent
individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be
targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. Thanks to
MonaLisaOverdrive for pointing out this story.

Battery pack, huh what???

You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.

Well, here's my semi-coherent rant for the moment.  ;)

I have >3100 spamtraps on my machine (you can multiply that by each domain
if you really want to).  The vast majority (all but, say, 10) have never
ever existed.  Yet, spammers would semi-continuously connect, try to
deliver mail to 40 of them, disconnect, connect again, try delivering
to 40 more...  over and over, they kept getting ""User unknown"" until I
got around to making them spamtraps.

So my evidence would suggest that it depends who you're dealing with. :)
If your ""business"" is to sell address lists to people who would then spam,
it's in your best interest to never clean your list.  Therefore you can
say ""10 million email addresses"" and not technically be lying, even if
the majority of them don't work.

If you're a spammer, you'd want to know who doesn't actually exist, but
then again you don't really care: you probably want to relay through
someone so it's harder to trace you, if you could you'd send to every
email address available, you don't want to setup a valid bounce address
because again it's easy to trace you.

So I would say this, if you technically spam people but actually think
you're running a legit service, you probably really do have a way of
opting out (even though the user didn't opt in) and you probably don't
relay, and you probably pay attention to bounces.

Everyone else doesn't really care.


That's my view anyway. :)

Chemistry types have a method for
dealing with this question without
dragging in the calculus:

Suppose an atmosphere to be mainly
affected by gravity, resulting in
the potential energy for a mass M
to be linear in height h: Mgh.

What relative concentrations will
we have when two different packets
of air are in equilibrium?

If they are at the same height, we
will have half the mass in one, and
half the mass in the other, and the
amount flowing from one to the other
balances the amount flowing in the
opposite direction.[0]

If they are at differing heights,
then a greater percentage of the
higher air tends to descend than
that percentage of the lower air
which ascends.  In order for the
two flows to balance, the higher
packet must contain less air than
the lower, and the mass balance
of the flows corresponds thusly:

    high percentage of thin air
    ---------------------------
    low percentage of dense air

Now, rates are exponential in
energy differences[1], so that
theoretically we should expect
an exponential decay in height,
to compensate.  How does it go
in practice?

-Dave

[0] How well does it balance?
    Chemical equilibria seem 
    stable, as they deal with
    very large numbers over a
    very long time.  Economic
    equilibria are viewed from
    the mayfly standpoint of
    individual people, and so,
    at best, the shot noise is
    very visible.

[1] That is to say, rates will
    be exponential in the free
    energy differences between
    endpoints and a transition
    state.  We can ignore that
    complication in this model.

This is not a correct assessment.  The American public couldn't care
less.  However, the US intelligence community correctly perceives a
threat, and it isn't the third-world.  Many European and other developed
nations aggressively engage in covert operations against American
interests.  Its been going on for years and isn't even news.  Things
have stepped up in recent years and the US DoD is none too pleased.  For
better or worse, the US is relatively good at that game too.  As with
most backwater wars, they are proxies for the interests of the big
players.

Find a current list of the top intelligence threats to the US.  You'll
find that half the countries on that list are European.  Most people are
unaware of how aggressive these things have gotten in recent years.

Bullshit.  The European governments ruthlessly suppress real opposition,
obviously some more than others.  US SpecOps are often brought in to do
dirty work inside Europe for European governments (usually with
government ""advisors"" along for the mission).  I've always wondered what
the deal was such that we got involved at all.  The point being that
we've acted as assassins for European governments inside their borders
against their own citizens under the auspices of those governments, and
in recent years, not ancient history.  I know SpecOp guys who left the
military specifically because of the circumstances of some of these
missions while they were posted for that duty. I'm certainly glad I was
never assigned missions in that theater, because there is a lot of
covert nastiness going on in nominally friendly European democracies.

Regardless, giving money to people that threaten you has never created
meaningful peace in the history of civilization.  We call it extortion
under any other guise.

Europe is looking increasingly like a basket case.  Whatever problems
the US is having these days, Europe looks worse and is going downhill
faster.  Why the US would want to emulate European behavior or the
European way of doing things is beyond me.

The US asking for major policy advice from Europe is like asking a quack
for medical advice.  I really don't see what is wrong with ""unilateral""
anyway.  Why should anyone join a stampede that is heading for a cliff?
I hope the incessant knee-jerk conformist screeching that Americans see
coming from Europe doesn't actually represent the views of Europeans. 

For various reasons I'm not exactly a cheerleader for the US government,
but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.

I'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage.  The vast
majority of people I know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the
country at one time or another.  And I doubt Europeans have traveled
anywhere near as much in the Western hemisphere as Americans have. 
Despite the best efforts of France, Europe is *still* not the center of
the universe.  I'll throw you a bone though: most Americans do consider
Europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it.  But
from the perspective of an American, how could you NOT look at it this
way?  The impact of Europe on America has diminished greatly over the
years.

I love the smell of Euro-chauvinism in the morning.

First, you assume that the North American continent is ethnically and
culturally homogenous.  Anybody that has actually traveled throughout
North America knows this isn't true; there are more than five major and
very distinct cultures and societies in the US alone, never mind the
hundreds of diverse regional sub-populations, some of which are truly
foreign.  Apparently Europeans confuse speaking the same language with
having the same culture.  That would be like saying Mexico is culturally
identical to Spain because they nominally speak the same language.  A
Wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with
your average person living in San Francisco, despite speaking the same
language and nominally living in the same country.  If I want to visit a
wildly different culture for the holidays, I'll go to Oakland, New
Orleans, or similar -- they are far more different from where I live
than some countries I've traveled to.  And a lot of these places are
farther from where I live than Spain is from Germany.

Second, the State I live in is the size of Germany.  When I travel to a
neighboring State (which I do regularly), how is this not equivalent? 
In fact, I probably travel much farther for the holidays than your
German construction workers.  If you look at the EU as a single country,
only then does your analogy become comparable.  What kind of ridiculous
superiority do Europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries?

In truth, I find Europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the
US.  There are a lot of cultural similarities across the EU with
relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very
similar to the US.  The only real difference is that Europeans have
dozens of different languages, which is hardly something I would call an
advantage.  Although there are a couple parts of the US where I can't
understand a word they are saying either.

G] What HOWTOs for SOHO system,"Hi All,
I'm trying to set up the following:

1. A Linux server running with a modem for internet connectivity and an
ethernet card for LAN connectivity
2. Other LAN pcs with ethernet cards, using the Linux server for
DNS/DHCP etc.

Basically, I want to route any non LAN traffic through the ppp0.

I've got some of the way, but like a similar post earlier about modem
problems, when I am connected to the internet with eht0 up, the routing
is all incorrect and noting goes out through ppp0 (eh0 must be the
default route or something).

Is there standard ""out of the box"" Linux tools that will carry out
portmapping on behalf of the LAN PCs ?  (I'm planning on non routable
addresses 192.168.x.x for the LAN, routed outwards via the ppp0
interface).

Can someone point me at the right HOWTOs or routing documentation I need
to follow ? 
Thanks,
Dermot.

Anolther sequence related traceback,"I have some patches that seem to fix/avoid this problem now.   (It is
amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for
UPS's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and
its battery supply...)

First, I put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was
occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a
sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of
such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback.
This one solves the initial problem:

+	    continue;
+	}
 	set parts [split [string trim $range] -]
 	if {[llength $parts] == 1} {
 	    lappend seq $parts


That is amending proc MhSeqExpand which is where the error was occurring
before (the code assumes that $range is either NNN or NNN-MMM so we should
probably make sure that's true - issue an error instead of just ""continue""
if you like, but I don't think an error is needed).

But that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place,
by typing ""NNN-"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this,
I thought I should think more about Brent's suggestion.   But rather than
have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it
would have to know what is to be valid, I decided that the right thing to
do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so I just stuck
a ""catch"" around the MsgShow that is processing the nonsense that the
user has typed.

This way, any later expansion to what MsgShow treats as legal (maybe
allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can
be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have
to go fix the selection processing code to allow it.

But, while I was playing there, I noticed something I never new before.
If you type ""66+"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each + that
is typed).   I suspect that's perhaps an artifact of ""+ is bound to a
different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the
current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current
input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now I found it,
I think its nice.    But if we can type 66+ why not 66- as well?  That
kind of limitation bugs me, so I fixed it.

And then I wondered about folders with names containing '+' - the special
use of + as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from
the keyboard.   So I fixed that as well.   This makes two different
restrictions - there's no way to type a folder name that has a name
beginning with '+' (but such a thing in MH would be a pain to use anyway,
so I doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to
toggle between typing the current & target folder name when the name
being typed is empty.   I'm less happy about that part, but I think I
can live with it in order to allow folder names with +'s in them to
exist and be typed.

Then, since I was there anyway, I decided to do something about another
feature that has always bugged me.   In ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is
the key used to show a message.    But if you've just typed 123, and
the FTOC is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now
show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type \r instead.
So I ""fixed"" this one as well.   ""Fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes
that the keybinding for MsgShow is 's', if you change that to something
else, it will remain 's' in here.   I don't know enough tk/tcl to have it
discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order
to bind the same one here.   \r continues to work of course.

And now I got started in fixing irritants in this code, I also made it
clear the status line if you abort message/folder entry mode (^C or ^G).
Previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next
message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had
reverted to its usual bindings.

In any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that.   I believe
that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the
""catch"" around the ""MsgShow"" will hide the problem (I don't think we really
need to fix Brent's way of invoking it).   Or include it anyway, just
for completeness (I haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not
the previous one, so I don't know for sure that all will be OK then).

We're in violent agreement there:  the comments in tokenizer.py say that as

Yup, the system picks up on *everything* in the tokens.  Graham's proposed
""delete as ham"" and ""delete as spam"" keys would probably work very well for
motivated geeks.  But Paul Svensson has pointed out here that they probably
wouldn't work nearly so well for real people.

I'll soon check in this change:

        HTML tags are always stripped from text/plain sections.

        By default, HTML tags are also stripped from text/html sections.
        However, doing so hurts the false negative rate on Tim's

Very reminiscent indeed.  Ayatollah Chirac has decreed a death

millions of euros bounty for his head, so he has gone into hiding
under police protection for a few years.

Or maybe some handful of Muslims are acting uppity and dragging him to

dem da massive respect dat dey deserve, especially these days.

Or maybe some journo is trying to fill column inches on a boring day.


BTW I read Houellebecq's ""Extension du domaine de la lutte"" recently,
about a depressed computer services dude working in Paris, looking for
love and not finding it, slowing losing his marbles and trying to get
a friend of his to kill a woman, and ending up in a clinic for
nutcases...  Yikes!  Purposely provocative, very depressing, with some
unbelievably boring passages where the anti-hero writes little stories
about animals talking philosophical mumbo-jumbo to each other, quoted
inline in full for pages on end.

It starts out:

""On Friday evening, I was invited to a party with some colleagues from
work.  There were about thrity of us, all professionals aged from
twenty-five to forty.  At one point, some cunt started getting
undressed. She took off her T-shirt, then her bra, then her skirt, all
the while making unbelievable faces.  She pranced around for a few
seconds, then she started getting dresesd again because she didn't
know what else to do.  Anyway she never sleeps with anyone.  Which
underlines the absurdity of her behaviour.

After my fourth glass of vodka I started to feel pretty bad so I had
to go lie down on a bunch of cushions behind the couch.  Shortly after
that, two girls came and sat on the couch.  Those girls are not pretty
at all, the two fat office cows actually.  They go to eat together and
read books about the development of language in children, all that
sort of stuff.""

... and it's downhill from there!

k and Luck,"Anyone who doesn't appreciate both PLUCK and LUCK is only looking at
part of the equation.

America has, in fact, moved hard toward Meritocracy.  But -- and this is
a huge one -- you don't necessarily find it on the Forbes list.  There
is an element of LUCK, even if only being in the right place at the
right time, to go that high.

Beyond the Forbes List, there are many ways in which almost pure LUCK is
involved in significant wealth.  Being a super-model, for example.
Though I think most people would be surprised by a lot of super-models.
Cindy Crawford was valedictorian of her high school.

Most people, of course, aren't in those stratified realms.  It is the
rest of us who tend to sort.

There is a huge philosophical problem with the concept of Merit in the
first place.  Rawls claims Merit doesn't exist.  Sowell seems to agree
at least in part, but I'm sure Sowell would also state that the benefits
of pretending it exists for society at large are enormous.

And if Merit does exist then exactly what is it measuring?  IQ?  Purity
of heart?  Or the ability to satisfy customers?  Functionally most
people seem to equate Merit with IQ though they say it would be better
if it were purity of heart.  Yet the type of Merit that lands you on the
Forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door'
is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition.

Differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far
more animosity than differences due to luck.  Luck can be forgiven.
Superior performance, often not.

EBusiness Webforms: cluetrain has left the station,"I'll agree that webforms are a pain in the ass, however it would seem to 
me that the problem with passport is the same one you noted with the 
autoform function, providing more info than you want to.  That and some 
entity would be holding the passport info, thus have all that data in the 
first place.
Personally i'd never trust them not to at least use it internally to 
market to me, if not sell/rent out.  Just think of the ability 
they'd have to build a profile for you since everything you went to was 
tracked to you.  And thats just the marketing side of it.

$199 PC Doesn't Do Windows,"

     New $199 PC Doesn't Do Windows
     - Oct 2, 2002 03:53 PM (AP Online)

AP Technology Writer
  
  It's been about 20 years since a new Atari 400 or Commodore Vic
20 could be had for less than $200. Even then, those relics were
well on their way from bargain bins to the dust bin of PC history.
  Since then, few if any new computers have sold for less than
$200. Any that did were seriously outdated or inoperable.
  Now, in a challenge to established tech giants, several upstarts
have banded together to create a PC that retails for $199.86.
  It doesn't do Windows. In fact, it doesn't do a lot of things.
  The Microtel SYSMAR710, sold only at Wal-Mart's online store,
runs on a Linux operating system variant called Lindows, which has
been hyped as a new choice for consumers who want to break away
from the Microsoft monopoly.

I havent used the FBSD poll, as it's not portable, select and poll(still not
100%) are all that exist in the UNIX world. Redhat of course doesnt count as
portable either, but it's nice they are trying. The Windows I/O model does
definately blow the doors off the UNIX one, but then they had select to
point at in it's suckiness and anything would have been an improvement. UNIX
is just now looking at it's I/O model and adapting to a multiprocess
multithreaded world so it's gonna be years yet before a posix API comes out
of it. Bottom line is the ""do stuff when something happens"" model turned out
to be right, and the UNIX ""look for something to do and keep looking till
you find it no matter how many times you have to look"" is not really working
so great anymore.

And will run Solaris 9 when Sun catch up with the x86 drivers and kernel.

Although don't hold your breath for the free DVD. It will never come.

(Spot the person who applied for the free Solaris 9 DVD, only to be told
three months later it is no longer available.<mutter>)

FWIW Solaris and Linux seem to be getting closer all the time. I can no

hmmm.

Peter.

Open a terminal and as root type
lsmod
you want to find a module called
NVdriver.

If it isn't loaded then load it.
#insmod NVdriver.o
Oh and ensure you have this module loaded on boot.... else when you reboot
you might be in for a nasty surprise.

Once the kernel module is loaded

#vim /etc/X11/XF86Config

in the section marked
Driver I have ""NeoMagic""
you need to have
Driver ""nvidia""

Here is part of my XF86Config

ing the Point,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85471617
Date: Not supplied

A lot of people seem to be missing the point of Phoenix, as evidenced by the 
responses on Mozilla News[1] and MozillaZine[2]. Let me emphasize something 
here: if you think Mozilla's current UI is acceptable, then you are clearly not 
the target audience for Phoenix.

Here is a quiz to test whether or not Phoenix is the right browser for you.


- The link toolbar is: 


- critical to my day-to-day use 
- vital when using Bugzilla! Doesn't everybody use Bugzilla?
-  link what?



- The sidebar is 


- indispensable since i run at 1600x1200 resolution 
- not cool enough, since i can't float and dock all my panels and have 
splitters between all panels and see web page progress for individual HTML 
panels and check my email entirely from within sidebar and... 
- a waste of real estate



- Form auto-fill 


- is not useful for me unless I can fill out 20 pages of personal information 
first 
- should just happen automatically



- Downloads 


- should take place in a tree view with progress meters in the columns! 
- should be clearly visible and understandable.



- Toolbars should 


- be dockable to all four corners of the screen, be able to float outside the 
window, be fully customizable such that I can make my own custom commands, be 
able to edit existing buttons' commands, be able to create my own toolbars, be 
able to put toolbars on the same line, and be able to edit the submenus and 
context menus of items (including the items on the menu bar) and browse my file 
system and cook me dinner and wash my car and walk my dog and do my taxes and 
mow my lawn and... 
- be customizable within reason



- Composer should 


- always come with my browser. I want composer options all over my UI. 
Everywhere! 
- not be part of a Web browser.



- Mail should 


- be part of my browser program. Aren't they the same app? There is a 
difference? 
- be a separate application.




Now to those people who want the full-blown functionality of the Mozilla trunk, 
you can still get that with Phoenix. The idea is to relegate more features to 
the ""optional add-on"" category. If you want the link toolbar or the sidebar or 
mouse gestures or any other features, you can download and install them 
yourself. I expect Phoenix will have a little add-in manager that will 
facilitate this process. There is currently an expectation on the part of an 
alarming number of people that every feature implemented by anyone should 
automatically be part of the default Mozilla install/download. 

Why? 

A layered approach scales better. You can then have a browser that can become 
as complex as you want to make it, but the choice is left in your hands. The 
geek features aren't inflicted on you by default.

Finally, remember that Phoenix's UI is not controlled by Netscape. This is an 
opportunity for some of the core Mozilla Navigator developers to build the 
browser that they have always wanted to build, without having to compromise the 
user interface to satisfy the various conflicting pressures exerted by factions 
within Netscape.

rnational agreements,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513638
Date: Not supplied

Eli the Bearded sez: 

    Ever wanted to see an international agreement? There are an awful lot of 
    them here, and the ones I looked at were surprizingly readable. I was 
    looking for the Balfour Declaration, the thing I saw cited as the start of 
    Israel recently. Suprizingly this document is only four paragraphs. The 
    Oslo Accords (Israel/PLO agreement of 1993) is another thing much shorter 
    than I had imagined.

It's a myth that we don't use parts of our brain.  We use it all,
always.  It's just that our culturally-induced focal-point causes most
of us to most of the time ignore and waste 99.999% of it.  ""Lucid"" is
a measure of notch-filter bandwidth; all stations are broadcasting,
but we only /choose/ Easy Rock 105.

For example, don't look now but your shoes are full of feet.

The sensation of toes the above statement evokes is not a ""turning on""
of circuits, it is a ""tuning in"".  The next step, of course, is to
""drop out"" :)

To paraphrase an old saw: Life is wasted on the living.

This is a good point. There are a lot of alternatives to hydrocarbon
products derived from petroleum, but these have often been developed as
a replacement for petroleum after the technology has been established -
there is a growing industry in plant-derived plastics and lubricants,
but this is to replicate materials that have been previously created 
much more easily within the petrochemical industry.

Vegetable-derived lubricants have been used. The Russians used sunflower
oil in the lubrication systems of tanks and trucks during the second world 
war, and work is being done in the UK to produce diesel fuel derived from
waste cooking oil from fast-food restaurants. 

Jay's correct in his opinion that vegetable oil is not as durable as 
petroleum oil, but this is only because of the lack of sophistication 
of the chemistry involved. Synthetic fuels and lubricants are continuously
being developed, and I don't see any problems with synthetics ultimately 
matching the performance of the more conventional products. As the rock
oil runs out, plant oil derivatives *will* be developed to fill the
gap. In parallel, changes will occur in the designs of the machines to 
cope with any changes in performance of the lubricants.

My big concern is if the technology were ever to be lost for some reason.
Re-creating a petrochemical industry from scratch without petrochemicals
(that is, going immediately to plant-based synthetics) would be extremely 
difficult, especially if it were necessary to recreate *all* of the
petrochemical-derived products (not just lubricants and fuels). I suspect
that, bearing in mind the ingenuity of the human race, it would happen,
just at a different pace. Imagine an industrial revollution based on,
for example, methane from pig manure, or diesel oil from sunflowers.

All we would then have to do is get used to all the machines smelling
like pig farms and fish and chip shops...

Hmm.. I've seen the *opposite* issue - if I go to *SEND* a signed message,
sometimes Exmh will put up the dialog box, but fail to set keyboard focus
there, so no passphrase can be entered.  Of course, hitting 'return' doesnt
work so you need to click the 'OK' box, at which point it finds that the
passphrase that wasn't entered doesn't work, and asks again, this time with
proper focus set.

I suspect some variable/codepath is getting hosed for the focus, or possibly
some borkedness with --no-tty and/or --status-fd flags to gnupg.

Say you have installed synaptic-0.24-fr1 on your Valhalla box (package
rebuilt for Valhalla). Then you upgrade to Psyche using the Red Hat CDs.
Hopefully with the compat libraries the package will still be there
(although I doubt that since C++ is binary incompatible, so this is
probably a bad example), then you ""apt-get update"" with the new Psyche
repository... and there's where the problem will be : It will say that
there are two synaptic-0.24-fr1 packages (one installed, the other
available) with the same version but different dependencies :-/
That's why I always keep package versions lower for older distributions.

Across my data, all-caps DATE, SUBJECT, TO, etc indeed appear only in the
spam collections.  OTOH, they don't appear often -- less than 1% of spam

Alas, that's wrong. Both the drives are faster (10..15 krpm vs. ~7 krpm,

None of them are production quality. Right now only ext2 and ext3 qualify.

Have you looked inside a dual-CPU 1U Dell? Three drives are easy to get

I can't think of a single major vendor who sells 1U systems with hardware

I believe you that stuff can be found, if one is looking for it. However,

I may have a different version of ""sh"" than you do; the double quotes
around the backticks work for my ""sh"".

(In the more-than-you-really-wanted-to-know category, you're probably
safe without the double quotes.  The only reason I put them in is that
I have some pathologically-named folders, including folders whose

Who's the real monster?


It seems good Ol' Uncle Dave is once again trying to savage anyone that
dares to disagree with him.  It seems Ben, Kevin and Bill are making too
strong a case.  So here we Dave's attempt to fool you into thinking they're
some sort of monsters, violent ones no less.

Anyone who works with Hemenway or Kearney should be aware that these people
are nothing less than monsters, who will stoop to any level to get their
way.

Yeah sure Dave, whatever you need to believe.

The truth is these folks do a fine job of actually helping others and
improving RSS in general.  Each with their own brand of attitude, to be
sure, but they seem to be pretty focused on actually helping things move
forward.  How is that being monstrous?

Is Dave trying to slander their good names and thus poison the public's
perception of them?  If you haven't already, contact them and ask them how
they feel about this foolishness.

Dave deflects what he can't take the time to understand


It's really quite pitiful.  When normal people don't understand something
they usually try learning about it.  They read up, ask questions and seek
the help of those that understand it.  This before shooting their mouths off
and looking like fools.

What Dave does is just the opposite.

Posts a link to something he doesn't understand
Get's a bunch of e-mail from people who do understand it
Derides the idea as being 'too much trouble' and blogs it.
Expects others to do research for him
Abuses anyone who tries to help him
Pontificates, incorrectly, about only part of the issue
Realizes he's been a fool but refuses to correct himself
Plods forward pedantically trying to defend his idiocy
Tries making the educated people look like fools.
Sends private e-mails to them trying to scare them off.
Exposes any private e-mail they write, out of context.
Deflects and runs off to some new topic, repeats from #1
His continued diatribes about RSS-1.0 and it's use of RDF reveal this to be
true.  Dave doesn't get the idea of the semantic web.  He'd rather have you
follow his stupid ideas than dare admit that the work of others is worth
trying.

One reader wrote to us with a good analogy.  ""It's like that movie The
Poseidon Adventure.  Dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the
passengers should follow him and march toward the bow.  I don't know about
you but I'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room.
The ship's fucking sinking and I don't want to be following the idiot.""

Dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach
around.  You're supposed to just shut up and take it.  After all, why would
good ol' Uncle Dave want to hurt you?  It's all about love, right?  To hell
with asking you if you want to get shafted.  And if you dare complain, he
savages you.  Then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing
all the trouble.

We've news for you Dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking
amongst ourselves about it.  We're routing around you damaging behavoir.
That's where we're coming from.

If you have an example of how you've tried to help Dave, please drop us an
e-mail about it.  We'll keep it strictly confidential of course.  Send it
along to zaphod@egroups.com

Trying to talk with Dave is like trying to wrestle a pig...


The trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it.

Another developer tries talking to Dave and discovers it's fundamentally
impossible:

His basic response was just that RDF was a joke and the Semantic Web
developers are doing a terrible job.

In the span of less than five minutes Dave makes such an ass of himself that
people at other tables start whispering ""that guy is an idiot...""

Aha! Some backing down by the whining one?


It would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that Dave's been trying on
his crappy little set of RSS hacks is failing to gain support.

I'm going to push back the caveat-removing on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours.
Still have work to do on the sample file, I want to look into the RFC for
time-date specs, and get started on the Radio implementation of 2.0. I have
to prepare for Seybold tomorrow, and I want to a little memorial for 9-11. A
busy few days for a guy still recovering. Also, it would be great if people
who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any
deal-stoppers.

Hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use
it!

The poor Radio customers!  The poor Salon blog users!  They're going to be
dragged unwillingly into producing XML content that nobody will use!  So
with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch Dave is going to turn all their
content into totally unsupported garbage!!!

Ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start
getting rejected!

Of course at the same time Dave tries to play the sympathy card.  What utter
fucking nonsense.  This past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his
'blame America' bullshit.  Then the RSS community tells him to get stuffed
with his dictator release of RSS.  Now he's trying to pretend we should be
nice to him because he's still recovering?

Uh, Dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking
fights.  We'll still kick your ass regardless.  That's what years of your
abusing people has gotten you Dave.  No sympathy anymore, none whatsoever.

Luserland Attempts to Trademark ""RSS""


Dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any
BigCo that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally
bankrupt. Scripting News is full of examples.

So we found it surprising, as did many others, when Luserland software tried
to patent the term 'RSS' back in 2000. Here's the patent application:

http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&entry=78025336

This was apparently just between the start of the RSS 1.0 development
efforts, and the publication of the specification. Winer knew about the RSS
1.0 stuff - indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time.

Could Dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!!

Since when has Dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others
to do??? A good quote from before he filed the patent application:

Tim O'Reilly says patents are OK, he's just against stupid patents. In the
spirit of Touch of Grey, Tim man, patents are lock-in of the worst kind.
There's no way to route around them.

Agreed.

But I have always thought that the value 5 was not the best value.  It
should have been 0.  I understand that initially only spammy scores
were included.  But I believe the algorithm should be purely
symmetrical and non-spammy negative values should also have been
balancing out the spammy positive values, like they do in SA today.
Then anything that was positive would be spam and anything negative
would be non-spam.  (And I guess exactly zero is grey. :-) Today's
choice of 5 just adds an offset.  Which I think cause people to assume
things work differently than they do.

The actual follow-up to the Xing player break was more interesting than
that.  The mere knowledge of known plaintext (a corresponding input and
output) does not necessarily make it trivial to break a properly
designed systems and/or algorithm. The primary reason it was easy for
CSS is because the CSS key was only 40-bits, and thereby easy to break
with exhaustive search attacks.  It was only 40-bits (speculated)
because of a misunderstanding of the government cryptography export
rules at the time.

Even more interesting, to me at least, was that soon after the Xing
player break, people started studying the CSS algorithm itself.  They
rapidly found serious design flaws which left the 40-bit CSS algorithm
with an actual strength of around 23-bits (from memory, and new attacks
might have further reduced the strength).  This is another great example
showing why proprietary cryptography algorithms should be viewed with
the greatest of suspicion.

Yes and no.  You can put a limited amount of trust in a smart card.
There have been any number of very clever attacks against smartcards
(Ross Anderson in the UK has documented quite a few of these), and
smartcard manufactures are usually one step behind these attacks.  A
well designed system assumes that a system smartcard will be completely
compromised at some point, giving an adversary all of the secrets
contained in the smartcard.  The cryptography industry has developed a
variety of techniques that can reduce the impact of a compromise,
including unique keys per smartcard and forward security techniques.

Going back to the original question, once the encrypted material goes
outside the trusted hardware, it is impossible to ""unbreakably"" protect
it.  There may be some mitigation steps you can take, such as the SDMI
watermarking, but most schemes to date have been easily broken.  

Another consideration is the value of what you are trying to protect.
While there is no such thing as unbreakable, adding more cost (both in
terms of price and hassle-factor) can greatly improve the protection.
Since you are talking about the use of standard PC workstations, I
presume what you are trying to protect is not THAT valuable.  I'm afraid
most security measures don't come for free.

bad focus/click behaviours,"I've never understood the mouse buffer operation with exmh either. Here's the 
behaviour I have. I have exmh and XEmacs windows up, and a terminal window. (I 
also have gnome1.4 running and enlightenment as wm.) I select text in the exmh 
window and while it is highlighted, I can paste into anything else. If I select 
it and then click so the highlighting is off, then what I paste is not the 
recently-selected text in exmh, but an old selection. If I select in XEmacs and 
leave it highlighted, I can paste it into exmh sedit window; but if it is no 
longer highlighted, what I paste is an old selection. I can live with this 
behaviour except for one additional thing. If nothing is highlighted, then what 
I paste into exmh is different from what I paste into other windows. To be more 
specific, here's what gets pasted if nothing is highlighted:

Application       What gets pasted

XEmacs            whatever was last selected unless it was last selected in exmh
xterm             same as XEmacs
AbiWord           nothing
Nedit             nothing
sedit             Whatever was last highlighted in sedit and overwritten

The last needs some amplification. If I highlight something in sedit, then 
obviously that's what gets pasted. If the highlighting is off, then what gets 
pasted is NOT what was last highlighted in sedit, but what was last highlighted 
and typed over (I have ""Type Kills SEL"" on.).

It seems that exmh and sedit are the oddballs here. Very often when I try to 
paste something in sedit I end up muttering WTF??

High-Altitude Rambos
By BOB HERBERT

Dr. Bob Rajcoomar, a U.S. citizen and former military physician from Lake
Worth, Fla., found himself handcuffed and taken into custody last month in
one of the many episodes of hysteria to erupt on board airliners in the
U.S. since the Sept. 11 attacks.

Dr. Rajcoomar was seated in first class on a Delta Airlines flight from
Atlanta to Philadelphia on Aug. 31 when a passenger in the coach section
began behaving erratically. The passenger, Steven Feuer, had nothing to do
with Dr. Rajcoomar.

Two U.S. air marshals got up from their seats in first class and moved back
to coach to confront Mr. Feuer, who was described by witnesses as a slight
man who seemed disoriented. What ensued was terrifying. When Mr. Feuer
refused to remain in his seat, the marshals reacted as if they were trying
out for the lead roles in Hollywood's latest action extravaganza.

They handcuffed Mr. Feuer, hustled him into first class and restrained him
in a seat next to Dr. Rajcoomar. The 180 or so passengers were now quite
jittery. Dr. Rajcoomar asked to have his seat changed and a flight
attendant obliged, finding him another seat in first class. The incident,
already scary, could - and should - have ended there. But the marshals were
not ready to let things quiet down.

One of the marshals pulled a gun and brandished it at the passengers. The
marshals loudly demanded that all passengers remain in their seats, and
remain still. They barked a series of orders. No one should stand for any
reason. Arms and legs should not extend into the aisles. No one should try
to visit the restroom. The message could not have been clearer: anyone who
disobeyed the marshals was in danger of being shot.

The passengers were petrified, with most believing that there were
terrorists on the plane.

""I was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized
cabin,"" said Senior Judge James A. Lineberger of the Philadelphia Court of
Common Pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an
aisle seat in coach. ""I was afraid that I was going to die from the gunfire
in a shootout.""

Dr. Rajcoomar's wife, Dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her
husband, said, ""It was really like Rambo in the air."" She worried that
there might be people on the plane who did not speak English, and therefore
did not understand the marshals' orders. If someone got up to go to the
bathroom, he or she might be shot.

There were no terrorists on board. There was no threat of any kind. When
the plane landed about half an hour later, Mr. Feuer was taken into
custody. And then, shockingly, so was Dr. Rajcoomar. The air marshals
grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that
anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where
he was thrown into a filthy cell.

This was airline security gone berserk. No one ever suggested that Dr.
Rajcoomar, a straight-arrow retired Army major, had done anything wrong.

Dr. Rajcoomar, who is of Indian descent, said he believes he was taken into
custody solely because of his brown skin. He was held for three frightening
hours and then released without being charged. Mr. Feuer was also released.

Officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were
eventually identified by a Philadelphia Inquirer reporter as Shawn B.
McCullers and Samuel Mumma of the Transportation Security Administration,
which is part of the U.S. Transportation Department.

The Transportation Security Administration has declined to discuss the
incident in detail. A spokesman offered the absurd explanation that Dr.
Rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too
closely.""

If that becomes a criterion for arrest in the U.S., a lot of us reporters
are headed for jail.

Dr. Rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""I
had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""I was afraid that I
was about to be beaten up or killed.""

Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union have taken up his case and
he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful
detention.

""We have to take a look at what we're doing in the name of security,"" said
Dr. Rajcoomar. ""So many men and women have fought and died for freedom in
this great country, and now we are in danger of ruining that in the name of
security.""

The case for spam,"
Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me.  I like it a lot of the 
time, because as crap as it is at least it's not the kind of info you get 
on TV.  Particularly for small time local politics, it's the best way to 
get information.

but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as
well protected as any other political speech.  Spam is *the* tool for
dissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients
can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.

Not only do I know that, the post to which you were responding
explained that, with somewhat more detail than ""a joke"".  As you
should know, but evidently don't, poll() isn't even ""a bit better"" ---
in fact, it's about an order of magnitude worse --- for dense file
descriptor sets, which is the normal case.  (Except on operating
systems where select() isn't a system call but a library routine that
calls poll().)

You originally said:

  Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally
  catches up to Windows and has I/O that doesnt [sic] totally suck for
  nontrivial apps? No way!

The point --- my point, the point I was discussing; please don't try
to tell me you were trying to make a different point, because I don't
care --- is that you had no clue what you were talking about; Unix
hasn't been without this feature, and in fact has had it since you
were in elementary school, and operating systems without it don't
""totally suck for nontrivial apps"".

For what it's worth, glibc has actually implemented the aio_* calls
for a while, just in a way that doesn't scale to large numbers of
concurrent I/O requests.  I find references to the glibc
implementation as far back as 1999 and glibc 2.1.1, and I could
probably find much earlier references if I had time:
http://sources.redhat.com/ml/libc-hacker/1999-12/msg00070.html

(more details at

details on the SGI patch are at

Your original complaint was that Unix didn't do multithreading or
multiprogramming well.  Now that I've pointed out how obviously
idiotic that claim is, you've amended your complaint: now, although
individual Unixes do these things well, you complain that their
implementations are not entirely conformant with the POSIX threads
specification.  Well, that's probably true, but I haven't written
pthreads programs in C much myself, so I can't confirm it from my own
experience.  But, even if it's true, it's not a very good reason to
prefer Windows.

I'm sure you can provide examples of bugs in particular threading
implementations.  Spare us.  Just shut up.

Easy.

First, you'll have to excuse me as I'm still using 2.3.1 (*), so, this
may not play well with recent changes.  (I did look at 2.5.1, too).
And, I just did this off the top of my head (I wanted to see if it
(**) still worked), so this is somewhat untested.

Adding a menu entry is trivial; add this to your ~/.exmh/exmh-defaults:

*Fops.more.m.uentrylist:	ketchup
*Fops.more.m.l_ketchup:		Catch-up all b4 cur
*Fops.more.m.c_ketchup:	 	My_Mark2CurSeen

Then you just need to provide the source for My_Mark2CurSeen and 
arrange for Exmh to include it (put it in your ~/.tk/exmh directory
in your user.tcl; or in pick.patch if you enable the ""source hook""
under Prefs->Hacking Support)

It's going to look something like this:

proc My_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh pick msg
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)
    set pick(ids) [...get message ids for ""pick 1-cur""...]
    busy PickMarkSeen
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}

(that's based upon the guts of Pick_MarkSeen)

You need to fill in the code for the [...get...] section; I ran out of
time!

WRT the last, it's a small pile of Windows .exe files along with
cygwin1.dll.  The .exes are cmdline programs.  One is a POP3 proxy.  If I
currently have an email server named, say, mail.comcast.net, with user name
timmy, then I change my email reader to say that my server is 127.0.0.1, and
that my user name on that server is mail.comcast.net:timmy.  In that way the
proxy picks up both the real server and user names from what the mail reader
tells it the user name is.

This is an N-way classifier (like ifile that way), and ""all it does"" is
insert a

    X-Text-Classification:  one_of_the_class_names_you_picked

header into your email before passing it on to your mail reader.  The user
then presumably fiddles their mail reader to look for such headers and ""do
something about it"" (and even Outlook can handle *that* much <wink>).

The user is responsible for generating text files with appropriate examples
of each class of message, and for running the cmdline tools to train the
classifier.

Its interesting but in this part of the World (Nova Scotia) a recent 
study found that college graduates
earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). 
They did decline to mention
that the demand for some trades  is so great that some of
them are demanding university degrees to get in. Just for the record - 
the average salary for
a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is C$ 
21,000  -- < $14,000 US. No wonder
half of San Francisco has set up here - we have a whole whack of call 
centers that
have arrived here in the last couple of years - I think they hire some 
entry level IT people for around $10 ($6 US) an
hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me - my entry level job, in 
1986, paid $11.00 an hour. The fundamental difference
is that most of the jobs that require a trade are *unionized*.In other 
words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, 
 union dues are a better investment than tuition. The counter-argument 
to this is that many college graduates
 leave for better work elsewhere, but the counter-counter argument is 
that we are the thin edge
(one of several really - prison labor in the US would be another) of 
third-world wages and work practices coming
 to North America.

I worked at a company that had a 14-year wage freeze. The fact that they 
could maintain that (and prosper) just says
 volumes about the economy in this part of the world. I met many people 
there, like me, who felt that was fine, I can vote
with my feet. They didn't quite realize that just about every large 
employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. Anyway
eventually they started a union drive. During the vote, retired 
employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were
that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here - a bottle of 
rum) and somehow allowed to vote . The union filed
 a grievance - which was denied - by a Minister of Labour, who, hey, 
guess what - used to be a VP at the company.
That's free labor markets at work. The business continues to prosper - 
as I was told when I was there -  it is a cash cow as long
as the JOA (Joint Operating Agreement) with the competing paper is in 
place.

And if you think that any of those wonderful American companies, out of 
some free-enterprise belief in competing for the best talent,
are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received 
generous subsidies, in return, I'm sure, for an understanding about
the labor markets here.

Much as I like to accept what you say - I do believe in free markets , I 
have difficulty finding any - except of course for
labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well 
unless the supply is tight)
It was a great run with the technology industry - producing most of the 
self-made billionaires on
the list, but now we've got a government-sponsored monopoly, and the 
concept of ""more stuff, cheaper""
which it has always promised - seems to be disappearing. A particularly 
galling example is
high-speed internet access. An article I read a couple of years ago that 
it is an area where the pricing
approaches of the IT industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the 
telecom industry (maintain your
monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through 
the same regulators) meet.
Sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. The whole 
entertainment industry/RIAA/Palladium thing
seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer 
seems less important than using
regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to 
produce profits for the favored few.

I usually agree - but when there's a Republican in office -  I feel like 
they're the biggest believers in
the Manifesto, in reverse. Create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the 
rights of that ""proletariat"" you've
just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital 
in the hands of a few (ideally people
who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. Oh, 
and lie - use
the word ""compassionate"" a lot. I guess I tend to believe that a certain 
amount of poverty reduction actually
helps a modern capitalist state - the basic economic tenet of the 
Republic party seems to be the more homeless under
 each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be.

And the facts are, for most people in the Western world  are declining 
standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net,
greater working hours,  essentially since the entrance of women into the 
work force (not blaming women in any way, they have a right
 to work but its now 2 wage-earners in each family and still declining 
standards of living) is the reality.

Again to quote that wonderfully liberal document I keep coming back to - 
the CIA world factbook - on the US economy:

""Since 1975, practically all the gains in household income have gone to 
the top 20% of households""

The military already have these spy satellites; they are basically

My car is only just over 1.5 meters across and maybe 3 meters long, so
that means roughly six pixels total surface area.  You might find a
16-wheeler this way, but how often do people misplace a 16-wheeler
such that it is _that_ important to get old images of the terrain?
Since they can't send up aircraft to update images in realtime every
time, how is this different from just releasing the map on DVDs?  Why
wireless?

I thought of the common problem of lost prize cattle, but there again,
will there really be business-case for creating a hi-res map of
wyoming on the fly instead of just doing what they do now and hiring a
helicopter for a few hours?

I can see lower-res being useful for Geologists, but considering their
points of interest change only a few times every few million years,
there's not much need to be wireless based on up-to-the-minute data.
I expect most geologists travel with a laptop perfectly capable of DVD
playback, and I also expect the most interesting geology is in regions
where the wireless ain't going to go ;)

I don't mean to nit-pick, it's just that I'm curious as to (a) the
need for this product that justifies the extreme cost and (b) how we'd
justify the ubiquitous next-generation wireless network that this
product postulates when we /still/ can't find the killer app for 3G.

Taking things further off-topic: Does Habeus charge a license fee to
organizations who want to use their copyrighted material or is their sole
revenue stream to come from legal judgements?  On the one hand, if they
charge license fees, I'd worry that when times got tough they'd be somewhat
less critical of organizations we'd call spammers today in order to generate
license fees.  If not, I'd worry the pendulum would swing the other way and
they'd go after legitimate businesses in an attempt to generate more
revenues from judgements and/or out of court settlements.  Either way, it
seems like they have an interesting tightrope to walk.

dians again - something a little more substantive,"Politicians worldwide are discovering the internet - what a great tool 
for fascism, once you got the laws in place to solve that whole 
'anonymity' thing. Also I notice this story shows the truth - the

*Will Canada's ISPs become spies?*
By Declan McCullagh <mailto:declan.mccullagh@cnet.com>
Staff Writer, CNET News.com
August 27, 2002, 12:56 PM PT
http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1023-955595.html?tag=prntfr>

*WASHINGTON--The Canadian government is considering a proposal that 
would force Internet providers to rewire their networks for easy 
surveillance by police and spy agencies.*

A discussion draft <http://www.canada.justice.gc.ca/en/cons/la_al/> 
released Sunday also contemplates creating a national database of every 
Canadian with an Internet account, a plan that could sharply curtail the 
right to be anonymous online.

The Canadian government, including the Department of Justice 
<http://canada.justice.gc.ca/> and Industry Canada 
<http://www.ic.gc.ca/>, wrote the 21-page blueprint as a near-final step 
in a process that seeks to give law enforcement agents more authority to 
conduct electronic surveillance. A proposed law based on the discussion 
draft is expected to be introduced in Parliament late this year or in 
early 2003.

Arguing that more and more communications take place in electronic form, 
Canadian officials say such laws are necessary to fight terrorism and 
combat even run-of-the-mill crimes. They also claim that by enacting 
these proposals, Canada will be following its obligations under the 
Council of Europe's cybercrime treaty 
<http://news.com.com/2100-1001-268894.html>, which the country is in the 
process of considering.

If the discussion draft were to become law, it would outlaw the 
possession of computer viruses, authorize police to order Internet 
providers to retain logs of all Web browsing for up to six months, and 
permit police to obtain a search warrant allowing them to find ""hidden 
electronic and digital devices"" that a suspect might be concealing. In 
most circumstances, a court order would be required for government 
agents to conduct Internet monitoring.

Canada and the United States are nonvoting members of the Council of 
Europe, and representatives from both countries' police agencies have 
endorsed the controversial cybercrime treaty 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/CadreListeTraites.htm>, which has 
drawn protests from human rights activists and civil liberties groups. 
Of nearly 50 participating nations, only Albania has formally adopted 
<http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/searchsig.asp?NT=185&CM=8&DF=27/08/02>, 
or ratified, the treaty.

Michael Geist <http://aix1.uottawa.ca/%7Egeist/>, a professor at the 
University of Ottawa who specializes in e-commerce law, says that the 
justification for adopting such sweeping changes to Canadian law seems 
weak.

""It seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the 
changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to 
make changes,"" Geist said. ""To me that's not a particularly convincing 
argument. If there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, 
make that case.""

Geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new 
powers) are needed. I don't know that there have been a significant 
number of cases where police have run into problems.""

Probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is 
compelling Internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure 
their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and data-retention 
orders. The United States has a similar requirement, called the 
Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act 
<http://www.epic.org/privacy/wiretap/calea/calea_law.html>, but it 
applies only to pre-Internet telecommunications companies.

""It is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and 
Internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical 
capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national 
security agencies,"" according to the proposal. Companies would be 
responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment.

Sarah Andrews, an analyst at the Electronic Privacy Information Center 
<http://www.epic.org/> (EPIC) who specializes in international law, says 
the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""Their 
proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not 
just Internet providers,"" Andrews said. ""The cybercrime treaty deals 
only with computer data."" EPIC opposes 
<http://www.privacyinternational.org/issues/cybercrime/coe/ngo_letter_601.htm> 
the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and 
does not adequately respect privacy rights.

Another section of the proposal says the Canadian Association of Chiefs 
of Police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with 
personal information about all Canadian Internet users. ""The 
implementation of such a database would presuppose that service 
providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" 
the draft says.

Gus Hosein, a visiting fellow at the London School of Economics and an 
activist with Privacy International, calls the database ""a dumb idea.""

""Immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous 
mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the Internet 
anonymously,"" Hosein said.

A representative for George Radwanski 
<http://www.privcom.gc.ca/au_e.asp>, Canada's privacy commissioner, said 
the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on 
the paper as it stands.""

Comments on the proposal can be sent to la-al@justice.gc.ca 
<mailto:la-al@justice.gc.ca> no later than Nov. 15.

Good luck. Both were build on an RH 7.3 box with errata current as of the date of

can not remember if alsaplayer needs a --rebuild.

As an aside, alsaplayer is really maturing into a versitile app, I've been packaging

I've scripted the alsa-xmms cvs build, so it's easy to spin another one if these
rpms do not work on (null).

child beating mom an enraged con artist?,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85483138

Article about a scam expert who belives the mom who beat her child is a grifter 
belonging to the Irish Travelers. The reason she beat up her little girl, he 
thinks, is becasue she was pissed that the kid blew her con at a toy store. 

    Wright believes the beating happened for one of two reasons. ""The little 
    girl gave away the scam to an employee or the mom was so ticked off at not 
    getting refunds she took it out on the little girl."" 

I don't know anything about the Irish Travelers, but I'm wondering if they are

mbayes] python.org email harvesting ready to roll,"[followups to spambayes@python.org please, unless you're specifically
 concerned about some particular bit of email policy for python.org]

OK, after much fiddling with and tweaking of /etc/exim/exim4.conf and
/etc/exim/local_scan.py on mail.python.org, I am fairly confident that
I can start harvesting all incoming email at a moment's notice.  For the
record, here's how it all works:

  * exim4.conf works almost exactly the same as before if the file
    /etc/exim/harvest does not exist.  That is, any ""junk mail
    condition"" that can be detected by Exim ACLs (access control lists)
    is handled entirely in exim4.conf: the message is rejected before it
    ever gets to local_scan.py.  This covers such diverse cases as
    ""message from known spammer"" (reject after every RCPT TO command),
    ""no message-id header"", and ""8-bit chars in subject"" (both rejected
    after the message headers/body are read).

    The main things I have changed in the absence of /etc/exim/harvest
    are:
      - don't check for 8-bit chars in ""From"" header -- the vast
        majority of hits for this test were bounces from some
        Asian ISP; the remaining hits should be handled by SpamAssassin
      - do header sender verification (ie. ensure that there's a
        verifiable email address in at least one of ""From"", ""Reply-to"",
        and ""Sender"") as late as possible, because it requires DNS
        lookups which can be slow (and can also make messages that
        should have been rejected merely be deferred, if those DNS
        lookups timeout)

  * if /etc/exim/harvest exists, then the behaviour of all of those
    ACLs in exim4.conf suddenly changes: instead of rejecting recipients
    or messages, they add an X-reject header to the message.  This
    header is purely for internal use; it records the name of the folder
    to which the rejected message should be saved, and also gives the
    SMTP error message which should ultimately be used to reject
    the message.

    Thus, those messages will now be seen by local_scan.py, which now
    looks for the X-reject header.  If found, it uses the folder name
    specified there to save the message, and then rejects it with the
    SMTP error message also given in X-reject.  (Currently X-reject is
    retained in saved messages.)

    If a message was not tagged with X-reject, then local_scan.py
    runs the usual virus and spam checks.  (Namely, my homebrew
    scan for attachments with filenames that look like Windows
    executables, and a run through SpamAssassin.)  The logic is
    basically this:
      if virus:
          folder = ""virus""
      else:
          run through SpamAssassin
          if score >= 10.0:
              folder = ""rejected-spam""
          elif score >= 5.0:
              folder = ""caught-spam""

    Finally, local_scan.py writes the message to the designated folder.
    By far the biggest folder will be ""accepted"" -- the server handles
    2000-5000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100-500 are junk
    mail.  (Oops, just realized I haven't written the code that actually
    saves the message -- d'ohh!  Also haven't written anything to
    discriminate personal email, which I must do.  Sigh.)

  * finally, the big catch: waiting until after you've read the message
    headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic,
    because certain broken MTAs (including those used by some spammers)
    don't consider a 5xx after DATA as a permanent error, but keep
    retrying.  D'ohh.  This is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair
    amount of stuff is rejected at RCPT TO time.  But in harvest mode,
    *everything* (with the exception of people probing for open relays)
    will be rejected at DATA time.  So I have cooked up something called
    the ASBL, or automated sender blacklist.  This is just a Berkeley DB
    file that maps (sender_ip, sender_address) to an expiry time.  When
    local_scan() rejects a message from (sender_ip, sender_address) --
    for whatever reason, including finding an X-reject header added by
    an ACL in exim4.conf -- it adds a record to the ASBL, with an expiry
    time 3 hours in the future.  Meanwhile, there's an ACL in exim4.conf
    that checks for records in the ASBL; if there's a record for the
    current (sender_ip, sender_address) that hasn't expired yet, we
    reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or
    body.

    The downside of this from the point-of-view of corpus collection is
    that if some jerk is busily spamming *@python.org, one SMTP
    connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy.  This
    is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and
    bandwidth, but I'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam
    detectors.  Tim?

Happy harvesting --

        Greg

COMMENTARY

Rebuild at Ground Zero

By LARRY SILVERSTEIN

Earlier this month, we New Yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the
horrific events that befell our city on Sept. 11, 2001. All of those who
perished must never be forgotten. The footprints of the fallen Twin Towers
and a portion of the 16-acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic
amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish
that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and,
indeed, for all of us.

But for the good of the city and the region, the 10-million-plus square
feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the Twin Towers
must be replaced on the site.

About 50,000 people worked in the World Trade Center. Those jobs are lost,
along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity.
Together, those jobs in lower Manhattan, for which the Trade Center was the
economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15%
of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. Some of the firms
have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. New
York City is facing a budget deficit. Without additional jobs, the deficit
may become permanent. This is one reason for the importance of rebuilding.

If we do not replace the lost space, lower Manhattan never will regain the
vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. Love them or hate them,
and there were lots of New Yorkers on both sides of the issue, the Towers
made a powerful statement to the world that said, ""This is New York, a
symbol of our free economy and of our way of life."" That is why they were
destroyed. This is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and
with buildings that make a potent architectural statement.

In recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many
sources. Most of these focus not on the Trade Center site, however, but on
all of lower Manhattan. Further, many believe that the 10 million square
feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or
simply never rebuilt.

These proposals miss the point. What was destroyed, and what must be
recovered, was the Trade Center, not all of lower Manhattan. Except over
the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the
office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was.

Access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size.
That was a major reason why the Twin Towers were leased to 97% occupancy
before 9/11. None of the other sites proposed for office development has
remotely equal transportation access. With the reconstruction of the subway
and PATH stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements
planned, such as the new Fulton Transit Center and the direct
""Train-to-the-Plane"" Long Island Rail Road connection, the site becomes
even more the logical locus of office development.

And New York will need the space. Before 9/11, the Group of 35, a task
force of civic leaders led by Sen. Charles Schumer and former Treasury
Secretary Robert Rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60
million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the
anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. The loss of the Twin Towers only
heightens the need.

As for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown
cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, I would simply point out that
history shows them wrong. New York now has about 400 million square feet of
office space. All new construction underway already is substantially leased
up. New York had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the
beginning of the recession in 1990. By 1998, this space had been absorbed,
at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet.

We are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the Trade Center site
over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on
line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. This is an
annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s'
rate.

Those who argue that New York cannot reabsorb office space that it
previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an
extended period of stagnation and decline. I will not accept this view, nor
will most New Yorkers.

Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a recent interview with the New York Times
that the city ""has to do two things: memorialize, but also build for the
future."" I believe that the Twin Towers site can gracefully accommodate --
and that downtown requires -- office and retail space of architectural
significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what
happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as
residents of the area.

The challenge to accomplish this is enormous. But our city is up to the task.

Mr. Silverstein is president of Silverstein Properties, a real estate firm
whose affiliates hold 99-year leases on the World Trade Center site.

Exactly -- ""let's you and him fight"" is a
way of dealing with troublesome populations
by moving them next to one another, so they
give each other, and not the Man, grief*.

So by my understanding (and, you all will
understand, with tongue firmly in cheek):

Ireland:  Irish?  Uppity barbarians overly
   fond of ""risings"".  Scots?  More uppity
   barbarians overly fond of ""risings"".
   Why not plonk down a bunch of the latter
   next to the former and kill two birds
   with one stone?

Israel:  Ex-ottomans?  Uppity barbarians
   (didn't they help kick out the Ottomans?)
   Zionists?  Uppity sorts who aren't happy
   with perfectly good land in Uganda.  Why
   not plonk down a bunch of the latter next
   to the former and kill two birds with one
   stone?

but not:

India: in which the muslims and hindus were
    originally intermixed to some degree,
    but Partioned due to their own conflict,
    not due to English resettlement policy.

Canada: in which the french and english were
    already established, and it was just the
    balance of power on the continent that
    determined events in the colonies.  The
    Acadians got resettled, but they don't
    seem to have been that good for picking
    fights with their neighbors, so no one
    had them plonked down next door.

been used in some fairly large implementations and looked like some
pretty strong competition to commercial systems:
- Midgard, http://www.midgard-project.org/ , a PHP-based content
management framework that with other programs combines to be a full CMS
- Redhat CCM CMS, Java-based: http://www.example.com/software/ccm/cms/
- OpenCMS, Java-based: http://www.opencms.org

There was agreement that usability has not generally been an open source
strength, but both Plone and Xopus represented some real movement
towards improving that situation.

I was impressed by the spectrum of perspectives on XML. Some took for
granted that XSLT was relevant to content management, others took it
just as for granted that XSLT was irrelevant and seemed happy to ignore
XML almost completely. 

I attended realizing that ""content management"" is generally used to
apply to *Web* content management, but I was still a bit shocked how
completely out of scope document management was (almost no consideration
of the potential print/PDF dimension to content other than the
occasional ""...and you can use FOP to make PDF"" as if that was
functional): this seems more the case in open source content management
than in commercial content management, and probably makes XML easier to
ignore (if HTML is the be-all and end-all of the output...).

The honesty was refreshing, Phil Suh complained about the state of
current tools (both open source and commercial), and I wish I'd written
down what he said, something like ""it sucks so extremely, it sucks so
widely, and it is so generally sucking, that it seems sometimes there is
no hope."" For a moment there was contemplation that perhaps commercial
systems scaled so well that the commercial ""big boys"" were really much
more functional than open source, until someone pointed out, ""OK, take
some average blog software, spend $500,000 on the rollout... it'll scale
pretty well."" Another quote (citing Brendan Quinn): ""content management
problems are either trivial or impossible.""

Mac OS X is getting popular, of the laptops there it was an even 1/3
each of Mac, Linux, Windows.

I am sure it wasn't news to Jim, but I can't wait to try Subversion, a
CVS replacement that supports some of the newer features of WebDAV:
http://subversion.tigris.org/

I'm also eager to try Xopus, I hope the developers make it back home
safely, they said they'd only been in America four days but were already
homeless...

They weren't partitioned in any particular scheme - I think I'll write a

A new KPMG study concludes that the RIAA and its member companies are hurting

ways to earn a living with it. 

    Media companies must put less emphasis on protecting digital content and 
    instead find ways to make money from digital music and movies if they hope 
    to beat back copyright pirates who threaten their businesses, according to 
    a study released on Wednesday from KPMG... 

    ""They complain about the Napsters,"" she said, referring to the bankrupt 
    music swap site that was found to violate U.S. copyright laws. ""But why do

What does that exactly have to do with the statement that
distruption of peacable political assembly has become
a common practice disruption tool?  It's an observation
not a judgement, comment, approval.  You've focused on the

Ahm, if you don't object to using a mouse for such things, exmh has 
the ability to insert different sigs on demand.  Create a bunch of 
different sig files, all beginning with .signature, and at start up, 
exmh will load them all.  In the Sedit window, you'll see a Sign...
menu item which will allow you to select between each of the listed 
.signature files for *that* e-mail.  You can actually use several if 
you'd like (though I don't remember what Preferences... option allows 
for this).

However, the signature gets added on send, not inserted directly into 
the existing Sedit window prior to composition.

I currently have 6 different sig files I can choose between.

Additionally, if a .signature file has the execute bit turned on, 
exmh will attempt to execute the file and use the stdout of the 
script as your signature.

I hope this helps some.

It did for me, but I am not willing to say it is not a tcl/tk issue as
other apps seemed to work OK for cut and paste and Tk does its
clipboard stuff a bit differently than most toolkits. So I'm not
about to place blame. Just reporting my experience.

No that is appropriate content for the file.  I'm not a C programmer,
but I think that these sort of things (#include <blahblah>) are
instructions to the compiler processed by a pre-processor in the compile
process, and include all sorts of symbols/functions
e.g. ""#include <math.h>"" gives you maths type functions.  Since they
start with ""#"" they are ignored in the final compilation.

Regarding the rest of the compile process, you need to tell the PCtel
software to look in the right place for the kernel headers/source. 
I recall from your previous mail that there was a flag
    --with-kernel-includes=/usr/src/linux-2.4
which could be passed to the ./configure script (with the appropriate
directory in place of /usr/src/linux-2.4).  This might allow you to
persuade the code to compile against the correct headers.  I think this
is the right way to proceed.

Alternatively, maybe the steps above regarding ""make dep"" and so forth
should have been performed in the directory where the make process is
looking for modversions.h & Co.

I don't think it is a good idea keep moving files into the directory as
you describe below.  First of all you will move modversions.h (which you
have done), then you would have to move all those *.ver files, after
that, there will almost certainly be a need for further header (*.h)
files.  This could be quickly done, but is probably bad (those files
don't really belong there).

For what it's worth I think you are very close to a successful
compilation.

My typical Java-to-C conversion doesn't increase the lines of code by
more than 20%, and a fair portion of that is the implementation of
additional features that drove us to do the conversion in the first
place.  Some things are substantially more succinct when written in C
than in Java.  C and most other mature languages have an endless
collection of libraries.  I personally don't use anything beyond the
core libraries of any language that much though.

On a tangent, I find libraries nearly useless for a great many things
due primarily to the fact that most of them are so general that a given
non-trivial API almost always has a context in which it will function in
a pathological manner.  Code reuse is wonderful and all that, but
libraries frequently make design trade-offs that won't work for me even
if they theoretically do exactly what I need.  Unfortunately, it isn't
particularly easy nor does it make a nice simple API to design a library
that really is optimizable to a wide range of design cases.  I've built
a small collection of flexible psuedo-polymorphic APIs over the years
that I tend to use, but it is a pretty ugly solution for code reuse when
you get right down to it.

] Founding Fathers on Religion,"
Some interesting quotes...

http://www.postfun.com/pfp/worbois.html


Thomas Jefferson:

""I have examined all the known superstitions of the word, and I do not
find in our particular superstition of Christianity one redeeming feature.
They are all alike founded on fables and mythology. Millions of innocent
men, women and children, since the introduction of Christianity, have been
burnt, tortured, fined and imprisoned. What has been the effect of this
coercion? To make one half the world fools and the other half hypocrites;
to support roguery and error all over the earth.""

SIX HISTORIC AMERICANS,
by John E. Remsburg, letter to William Short
Jefferson again:

""Christianity...(has become) the most perverted system that ever shone on
man. ...Rogueries, absurdities and untruths were perpetrated upon the
teachings of Jesus by a large band of dupes and importers led by Paul, the
first great corrupter of the teaching of Jesus.""

] Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire (fwd),"

Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.

Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.

D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""

Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.

The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.

Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.

""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points.""

Huh?  Are you saying that whoever has the loudest voice gets to be heard?
Shouting down a public speaker could be considered a form of censorship. If
shouting down public speakers is 'protected' it is only a matter of time
before the people doing the shouting have their tactic used against
them -every single time they open their mouth-. The tactic is stupid and
non-productive and if generally used, will only result in chaos.  The tactic
is just stupid ego-bation at best, unless the goal is to generate chaos.
And humans whose goals and actions in life are to create chaos in society
should be locked up (provided you can accurately identify them, which is not
really possible anyway, but hey, this is my rant :-). IMHO.

One thing that's wrong is who some of us choose as babysitters.  Too many 
kids are put in front of the television for hours each day, to be 
influenced by what the media and government thinks is important.  I 
learned a long time ago that what they think is important and what is are 
two different things.  I threw the TV out when Xi was 9.  She's got her 
own place now, and still doesn't have one.  YaY!  Another thing that's 
wrong is what goes on in public schools.  Some allow a bit of 
individuality, but only for a class or a short period of time, depending 
on the teachers, most of the time.  I dunno how many times I've seen Xi 
come home from school absolutely miserable or outraged about something 
that happened at school.  She made it to college, though, whew.  It's a 
big problem to tackle, and I don't know the answer.  I like the idea of 
the voucher system, because in a way it is a way parents can vote more 
efficiently for how their kids are taught.

Yes, this is a big bonus of meta rules (new in 2.40); we can now
e.g. check for an Outlook-style forwarded message, and not give
it negative points unless it contains other signs of being from
Outlook.

When we get more (good) ""nice"" tests, the GA will assign lower
scores to them.  I think the current problem is that there are
very few really good nice tests in the current rulebase, and lots
of +ve tests that those newsletters hit, giving the GA a big
problem to solve.

[SAtalk] O.T. Habeus -- Why?,"Guys, the Habeas Infringers List (HIL) exists explicitly to deal with
spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in
other countries, where those judgments are harder to get.

Please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after
regular spammers.  Yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant
pyramid schemes, and ISPs have won some theft of service suits, but the
vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles.  So, I
can't understand how Daniel can assert that you can't track spammers
down when it's never really been tried.  We can subpoena the records of
the business they spammed on behalf of.  We can subpoena the records of
the ISP that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for
the whack-a-mole accounts.  We can use private investigators.  Yes,
these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners).  But, they're not
secret agents.  They're just trying to make a buck, and Habeas' whole
business is about finding them and putting them out of business

Habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark)
in a way that no one ever has had before.  Given that our whole business
plan relies on Habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", I can't
understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be
unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the
potential of success, which is anti-spam filters like SA acting on the
Habeas warrant mark.

Daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the Habeas scores yourself on
your installation.  If Habeas fails to live up to its promise to only
license the warrant mark to non-spammers and to place all violators on
the HIL, then I have no doubt that Justin and Craig will quickly remove
us from the next release.  But, you're trying to kill Habeas before it
has a chance to show any promise.

At the end of the day, SpamAssassin is like the Club, in that it
encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those
without SA) rather than yours.  Habeas can play the role of LoJack (the
transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't
steal any more cars.  But only if we're given a chance to succeed.

Haha!!!

Just a few notes:

 - It will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone
   in various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a
   good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.

 - Law suits take time. Between now and conclusion of the first court
   case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!

 - Contact information can change: phone numbers, PO boxes, stolen
   cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.

 - Spammers do not always remember to include contact information!  I
   don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright.  Also,
   some spam is non-commercial or sent by a third-party (for example,
   ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly
   required for the spammer to get their way.

It seems that several people are missing the point that this is NOT an image
database.  It is high-resolution topological data rendered in three
dimensions.  Images are overlayed on the topological data to help people
navigate familiar terrain visually.  In other words, it is not intended as a
wannabe spy satellite.  Rather it is a very accurate three dimensional model
of the earth's surface.  When a particular region in question is covered in
a city, the buildings in the city are mapped as though they are part of the
earth's surface.  The part that makes the app killer is that you can map all
sorts of data layers on top of their core topological data.

Got it?

Sony makes such a line of products.

My father was legendary for his abilty to break things.  His 'thumbs of death'
would rival anything a toddler could do to devices.  After countless numbers of
Walkman devices having their lids broken or buttons pressed into oblivion I
found the Sony devices.  I got him a ""My First Sony"" (be afraid of the
marketing) CD player.   It was /fire engine red/ but was completely
indestructible.  I hacked a headphone jack into it and gave it to him.  He
complained of it's looks but used it nonetheless.  I also gave him a pack of
headphones as there's no such things indestuctible headphones that aren't
obscenely bulky.

Now that we're riding up the curve of an ever increasing geezer population, how
soon before device makers get wise?  Not to be morbid, but would the marketing
be ""My Last Sony""?  <ducks and runs>

Your corpora are biased in this respect though -- newsgroups have a
strong social taboo on posting HTML, but in many people's personal
inboxes it is quite abundant.

Getting a good ham corpus may prove to be a bigger hurdle than I

This is true...it's now looking at more than just unseen, so it takes a little 
while (in the background) to build the sequences window.  There is probably 
some tuning possible in this area.

I changed the default display of unseen messages from a foreground of blue to 
a background of white to make it possible to see what other sequences unseen 
messages may be in.  I *did* ask Brent before I did it.  If you like the old 
behavior, the old lines are still in app-defaults-color, but commented out.

This is because of your Hook_MsgShow_update_unseen which is calling a function 
which no longer exists.

I suspect you need
	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) unseen $msgid
now instead of 
	Mh_MarkSeen $exmh(folder) $msgid

I think the ability to maintain an inconsistent database
is key to decentralization. 

Databases enforce consistenty with every transaction.
Bounded transactions, like an ATM, enforce consistency
  by have some play with time and value
Most people keep inconsistent data in their heads, it's
  called congnitive dissonance theory
Most businesses keep inconsistent data, documents, tationale
  and ideas to support their work activities, it's called real life.

I don't think it matters so much where it's located, i.e.
decentralization. I think that decentralization is the workaround
from technical limitations.  The fallout being that the only way
inconsistent information spaces can be maintained is by 
protecting them through a set of trust barriers and boundaries. 
The local information when combined with the technical
troubles of providing ""just enough"" forced synchronization
to remote information provide workable data consistenty, i.e.
enforcing local constraints or ignoring global ones when
concerns are more immedidate.  

Tolerating temporary, irreconcilable deviations is how
people cope, otherwise you'd be like Nick Gatsby unnecessarily
pre-occupied with a spot of shaving cream on McKee's neck
who thinks that if he can just wipe that spot off that the
whole world would be a little more perfect and everything,
including his pre-occupation with Daisy, would consistently
be in its proper place.

Once you have the serial changed on the master DNS server, remove

So it sounds as if, to your thinking,
most useful apps are also trivial. 
Unless each key on my keyboard were
(to the apps) distinct event sources,
I can't think of any of my usual job
mix that would need hundreds, or even
tens, of async requests; perhaps you
can explain how nontrivial apps will
be compellingly useful?

Does that lack of portability imply it
isn't generally useful?  (When it was
apparent that TCP networks were useful,
berkeley sockets could be found even
on VMS and Win 3.1 boxen)

Why would early Unix have run with the
idea that, if one wishes to do multiple
things at the same time, one can use a
group of processes to do them?

- they had Multics as a counterexample?

- in the days of tiny memories and tapes,
  people were more accustomed to writing
  programs that didn't run entirely in a
  single address space?

- one is a great number for an interface,
  as log(1) is 0, and specification can
  be implicit?

- some combination of the above?

Now, as Hoare says:
> There are two ways of constructing a software design.  One way is to make
> it so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other is to
> make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.

As programmers, we've been able to make
our lives complicated for at least half
a century; the hardware interrupt gives
us the rope.

Part of Dijkstra's inspiration for THE
was the counterexample of IBM's multi-
programmed boxes (were these the same
ones that inspired Mythical Man Month?)
and I suppose he would say the question
is how not to make a mess of it -- how
should we structure computations so if
we try to do ten times as many things
at the same time, reasoning about the
resulting system is at most ten times
more complex -- not one hundred, and
certainly not three and a half million
times more.

Compared to that project, the prospect
of writing a driver library for various
vendors' aio implementations seems to
be truly trivial.

(Oracle, in their quest for portability,
used to use raw disks for the database.
This finessed the filesystem issue; did
it also allow them to roll their own set

FWIW, I would now recommend doing this (using a user with a procmailrc)
instead of a system alias; more secure, and easier to filter out crud
like bounces, virii etc. that render a corpus dirty.

These are some good comments and I'd like to share an opinion here.  (Is that permitted? :)

I started using linux about 8 or 9 years ago in rebellion against what the university was doing with Winder$.  I just couldn't get good support and was using a lot of unix-based tools (ported to Winder$) anyway. So, I jumped ship and became my own sysadm.

What I got was the easy ability to use a shell (now ssh) to connect to my office box from just about anywhere and use either exmh or nmh (from the command line).  I can do email for the office fairly easily.

I haven't seen any other tools that let me do that yet.  But, I have to admit, that some of the web-based mail software is getting pretty close.  Quoting and such is still primitive, but they're moving forward.

No, but either due to some technical glitch, or downright just wanting
to do so, people send to the secondary.  It's a semi-usual spammer trick
actually to bypass the main server and send directly to a secondary
since it will either have less filtering, or be ""trusted"", or ...

MX records in the mail world are all explained in RFC 2821, section 5:

[...]
   Multiple MX records contain a preference indication that MUST be used
   in sorting (see below).  Lower numbers are more preferred than higher
   ones.  If there are multiple destinations with the same preference
   and there is no clear reason to favor one (e.g., by recognition of an
   easily-reached address), then the sender-SMTP MUST randomize them to
   spread the load across multiple mail exchangers for a specific
   organization.
[...]
   If it determines that it should relay the message without rewriting
   the address, it MUST sort the MX records to determine candidates for
   delivery.  The records are first ordered by preference, with the
   lowest-numbered records being most preferred.  The relay host MUST
   then inspect the list for any of the names or addresses by which it
   might be known in mail transactions.  If a matching record is found,
   all records at that preference level and higher-numbered ones MUST be
   discarded from consideration.  If there are no records left at that
   point, it is an error condition, and the message MUST be returned as
   undeliverable.  If records do remain, they SHOULD be tried, best
   preference first, as described above.

I have just installed spamassassin 2.31 in my postfix MTA server.

At first, I would like to test it just in my email account before 
applying it to the wole site.

I configured just as in the INSTALL file:

	5. Create a .forward...
	""|IFS=' ' && exec /usr/bin/procmail -f- || exit 75 #user""
	6. create a .procmailrc
	:0fw
	| /usr/bin/spamassassin -c 
			/etc/mail/spamassassin/rules

But the spams get trought it untouched. When I run it by the hand:

cat sample-spam.txt | /usr/bin/spamassassin -c 
				/etc/mail/spamassassin/rules

it does tag it as spam and send me the email.

what should I look at?

Thank you,

Yup, tagging data is mondo tedious, and mistakes hurt.

I expect hammie will do a much better job on this already than hand
grepping.  Be sure to stare at the false positives and get the spam out of

With probabilities favoring ham or spam?  A skip token is produced in lieu
of ""word"" more than 12 chars long and without any high-bit characters.  It's
possible that they helped me because raw HTML produces lots of these.
However, if you're running current CVS, Tokenizer/retain_pure_html_tags
defaults to False now, so HTML decorations should vanish before body
tokenization.

saurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil,"One of the most bizarre pages I've seen on the Web. At first I thought it
might be some sort of back-story to a RPG, but, nope, it looks like somebody
believes this.

===
http://www.viking-z.org/r20i.htm

M09. Dinosaurs Eggs and the Origins of Good and Evil.
DINOSAURS. Reptoid ETs are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on
their hind legs. This is a description of a dinosaur. It now appears in
Remote Viewing that the Reptoid ETs, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked
together and that they all originated on Earth. The Erideans who are Reptoid
derivatives have a home planet (in the Eridanus system) like all other ETs.
The Reptoids have no reported home planet. They also come over as entities
with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. This is a
description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see
them. Thus it could be that the Reptoids, Erideans, Nordics, Anunnaki, but
not the Greys, all have origins on Earth and have a strong link to Earth
even if they choose to live elsewhere. The Greys do not appear to have a
renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on Earth.
The definitive work on dragons is ""The Flight of Dragons"" by Peter
Dickinson. If dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long
bow. Targets do not come much bigger.

Truth is stranger than fiction. Thus the writer's current scenario is that
there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard
their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. They
survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.
They evolved into the Erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet
(for them) possibly with the help of another race of ETs who wanted slaves
but otherwise had no interest in Earth or mind control.

Thus it appears that the current Reptoids are the Spirits or ghosts of the
dinosaurs. They must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also
to appear to some people. They have appeared to the writer in remote
viewing. They are living on as vampire entities. Such immortal minds are
contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. If they can be
encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and
mind controllers will disappear. Encouraging them to reincarnate will help
so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great
difficulty surviving reincarnation. Purging people's dinosaurs should remove
all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. They are a source of
Satanic Guardian Angels and demons. They control us by owning our psi. Thus
if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of
all other mind controllers. Encourage people to regain ownership of their
psi.

THE ORIGINS OF LOVE, HATE AND PURE MALICE. The following scenario appears to
hold water and can account for the origins of our Universal Subconscious.

Dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of
rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young
hatchelings). They did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made
them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. In order to
keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. To do this
they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. This is an
act of hatred and outward looking. While a few dinosaurs did develop the
ability to bear living young, most did not. The dinosaurs got in first and
so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. They have
become the source of all Satans, devils and demons.

Birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep
them warm. A hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and
only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. Thus all eggs tend
to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. This is
primarily an act of love but inward looking. Bearing live young is not
suitable to a bird of the air. A pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.
Antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,
even if they are standing on ice.

Mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act
of love and inward looking. This is especially true as a mammalian female
can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird
sitting on a nest.

Dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,
while birds and mammals developed love. Birds and mammals certainly do hate
all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.

If one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then
purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. Unfortunately most of our
religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,
regardless of the front they put out to the public. Religion tends to
concentrate on ""How to Brainwash your Neighbour"". Conscious thought has
built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using
""How to care for and protect one's young"" as a foundation.

Thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something ""A load of
dinosaur's eggs"". Purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity
tends to purge all malice back to its roots.

It looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,
aided and abetted by various occultists and other. As they will insist on
vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the
serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.

ITEMS FOR INSPECTION. For mind control to take place, then someone must take
control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. Check for the
following.

Nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.
Eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing
hormones, abilities, etc.
Mind machines.
The original engraving or engram.
GOD and SATAN appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. T
hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. No doubt dinosaurs were the
first job holders.
TIMETRACKS are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of
time.

My, our, Man's timetracks, etc.
The time tracks of the Universe, Universal Subconscious, Galactic
Subconscious, etc.
EXTINCT RACES of ETs can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode.
Their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. Whenever
one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the
higher plane is a vampire one. One may never know what they looked like or
other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult.
Every extinct race, etc.
BLOOD ANCESTORS are also worth investigating as minds can be passed down via
genetic linkages. Some of these can be over 2,000 years old.
Every blood ancestor, ancestral mind, genetic mind, etc.

Possible - should be, it was possible to update to (null) from RH7.3 with 
apt. Did that on my laptop and well.. it was painfull to say the least 
(including a ecovery from totally corrupted rpmdb) Don't expect it to be 
an easy 'dist-upgrade' at any rate, so much stuff has changed and apt

It's possible but not supported by RH. I've upgraded both my laptop and my

I downloaded and played with it a bit, but had no time to do anything
systematic.  It correctly recognized a spam that slipped through SA.
But it also identified as spam everything in my inbox that had any
MIME structure or HTML parts, and several messages in my saved 'zope
geeks' list that happened to be using MIME and/or HTML.

So I guess I'll have to retrain it (yes, you told me so :-).

I have to agree here.  If Habeas is going to die just because SA does not
support it, that's a serious problem with the business model; but that is
nobody's problem but Habeas's.

A possible solution is for Habeas's business model to include some kind of
incentive for users of SA to give it the benefit of the doubt.  I have yet
to think of an incentive that fits the bill ...

This is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all
its incarnations) and MIMEDefang and several other MTA plugins all reject
at SMTP time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10).  
If some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1,
there'd better be _zero_ FPs, because all those filters would drop their
thresholds to 5.

Newsletters won't use the mark.  Habeas is priced way too high -- a factor
of at least 20 over what the market will bear, IMO -- on a per-message
basis for most typical mailing lists (Lockergnome, say) to afford it.

Sorry, that just can't work.

If the Habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in non-spam,
and effectively-enforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g.,
SA could assign a positive score to messages that do NOT have it, then
spammers are out of business and Habeas has no one to sue.  There's nobody
left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their
will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark.

Conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for Habeas to
make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose
for which it was designed.

Either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against
real spammers and a lot of cease-and-desist letters to clueless Mom&Pops,
then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights
to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both
created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that
everybody has to pay them for.

The latter would be quite a coup if they [*] could pull it off -- they do
absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with
lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly
from everyone on the internet -- effectively we'll be paying them for the
privilege of policing their trademark for them.  I don't believe they'll
ever get that far, but I don't particularly want to help them make it.

[*] And I use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could 
consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.

There's lots of similar places.  Saskatchewan, for example, once
shared with Iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per
capita, and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with
Iceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the

It's still curious Iceland leads.  Maybe there's just a deep cultural

Here is what you do.

Remove all the PCI & ISA/EISA cards.
Remove the floppy disk cable from the mobo, the ide cables from the mobo...
essentially leaving only a video card... ram and a keyboard plugged in.

Turn on the system.
If it doesn't POST then, switch it off and remove the video card.

Switch it back on ... if your mobo doesn't emit some beeps complaining about
lack of video card then.

Switch it off.
Remove it's ram.

Same procedure as above.

If you still don't have any kind of mobo beep codes then you can try as a
last ditch effort to reseat the cpu... (remembering to never ever ever power
up your system without a heatsink & fan).

If after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes,
from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,*isa cards or and
no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you
have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu.

Once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually
disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of POST.
Power On Self Test.

Are you running Gnome 1.4? I had similar problems as did several
co-workers. Updating my Gnome components has fixed it for me and
others, although I can't say exactly which component did the
trick. Gnomecore or gtk would seem most likely, but it may have been
something else.

In any case, I have not seen the problem for quite a while, now.

Senate Committee Passes Nanotech Bill
By Roy Mark

The Senate Commerce Committee unanimously passed on Thursday legislation to
promote nanotechnology research and development. Introduced by Sen. Ron
Wyden (D-Ore.), the 21st Century Nanotechnology Research and Development Act
would create the National Nanotechnology Research Program. The bill is
co-sponsored by Sen. Joe Lieberman (D-Conn.) and Sen. George Allen (R-Va.).

The proposed program would be a coordinated interagency effort that would
support long-term nanoscale research and development and promote effective
education and training for the next generation of nanotechnology researchers
and professionals.

""The unanimous support of the Senate Commerce Committee is a very big step
forward for this very small technology,"" Lieberman, who vowed to pushed to
full Senate passage before the end of the year, said. ""Nowhere in the world
are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of
nanotechnology. The U.S. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to
lead the world in developing this technology. Our legislation will provide
the nation with a long-term focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate
new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will

The bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology
program under the National Science and Technology Council. It would also
create a Presidential National Nanotechnology Advisory Panel and National
Nanotechnology Coordination Office, which would provide administrative and
technical support for the Advisory Panel and the Council.

""My own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to
change America on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer
revolution. I am determined that the United States will not miss, but will
mine the opportunities of nanotechnology,"" Wyden said in introducing the
bill. ""At present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a
half-dozen federal agencies. I want America to marshal its various
nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader
in this burgeoning field. And I believe federal support is essential to
achieving that goal.

To study the potential long-term effects of nanotechnology, a new Center for
Societal, Ethical, Educational, Legal and Workforce Issues Related to
Nanotechnology would also be established.

According to Lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the
National Research Council (NRC), which completed a thorough review of the
National Nanotechnology Initiative in June.

Those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel;
emphasizing long-term goals; striking a balance between long-term and
short-term research; supporting the development of research facilities,
equipment and instrumentation; creating special funding to support research
that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs; promoting
interdisciplinary research and research groups; facilitating technology
transition and outreach to industry; conducting studies on the societal
implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical,
educational, legal and workforce issues; and the development of metrics for
measuring progress toward program goals.

What I am specifically referring to is protesters shouting down speakers or
making so much noise that it interferes with the speaker. That's wrong,
immoral and unethical no matter what the political bent of the speakers and
the protesters. Rowdy protests in their own venue (on a college campus or
some of the commons areas of DC) is perfectly fine by me. Waving signs to
get attention is fine.

Well, Owen implied the protesters were arrested. Was he just jacking himself
off at the expense of other people? Exactly why is it a shame that they were
not arrested? Think about what you are saying and what you are telegraphing
about your state of mind here. You WANT people to do bad things (ie, police
arresting peaceful protesters) if it can help you further your cause? That
attitude just sucks. You have no moral ground to stand on if that is what
you believe.

Sure, just don't whine about getting arrested if you make it a point to get
in someone's face.

One other comment... Most of the people that are protesting against taking
out the Iraqi dictator wouldn't give a rats ass if a nuke went off in NYC.
They simply wouldn't care so why in the hell should the Americal public
listen to them on matters of national security?

So enlighten me, exactly why shouldn't Hussein be taken out? And if your
answr boils down to ""i don't give a shit about what happens to the US"", you
can kiss my ass :-)

I've done this.  It's not as pretty as I think it should be, but it works.  
I'm going to leave the cosmetic issues to others.  When I update the 
documentation, I'll add this to the exmh.TODO file.

I'm leaving for a 2 1/2 week vacation in a week, so this is the last new 
functionality I'm going to add for a while.  Also, I now have pretty much 
everything in there that I want for my own use, so I'm probably pretty much 
done.  I'll work on bug fixes and documentation before my vacation, and 
hopefully do nothing more afterwards.

Some Friends, Indeed, Do More Harm Than Good

September 10, 2002
By MARY DUENWALD 




 

Friends are supposed to be good for you. In recent years,
scientific research has suggested that people who have
strong friendships experience less stress, they recover
more quickly from heart attacks and they are likely to live
longer than the friendless. They are even less susceptible
to the common cold, studies show. 

But not all friends have such a salutary effect. Some lie,
insult and betray. Some are overly needy. Some give too
much advice. Psychologists and sociologists are now calling
attention to the negative health effects of bad friends. 

""Friendship is often very painful,"" said Dr. Harriet
Lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""The Dance of
Connection."" ""In a close, enduring friendship, jealousy,
envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will
rear their heads. One has to decide whether the best thing
is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this
is bad for my health and I'm disbanding it."" 

Another book, ""When Friendship Hurts,"" by Dr. Jan Yager, a
sociologist at the University of Connecticut at Stamford,
advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside.
""There's this myth that friendships should last a
lifetime,"" Dr. Yager said. ""But sometimes it's better that
they end."" 

That social scientists would wait until now to spotlight
the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering
that they have only recently paid close attention to
friendship at all. Marriage and family relationships -
between siblings or parents and children - have been seen
as more important. 

Of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead
to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. And
children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go
bad. 

As a popular author of relationship advice books, Dr.
Lerner said, ""Never once have I had anyone write and say my
best friend hits me."" 

Dr. Beverley Fehr, a professor of psychology at the
University of Winnipeg, noted that sociological changes,
like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the
role of friends in emotional and physical health. 

""Now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for
stability the way it was in the past, and because people
are less likely to be living with or near extended family
members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as
a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said Dr.
Fehr, the author of ""Friendship Processes."" 

Until the past couple of years, the research on friendship
focused on its health benefits. ""Now we're starting to look
at it as a more full relationship,"" said Dr. Suzanna Rose,
a professor of psychology at Florida International
University in Miami. ""Like marriage, friendship also has
negative characteristics."" 

The research is in its infancy. Psychologists have not yet
measured the ill effects of bad friendship, Dr. Fehr said.
So far they have only, through surveys and interviews,
figured out that it is a significant problem. The early
research, Dr. Fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a
friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. 

How can a friend be bad? Most obviously, Dr. Rose said, by
drawing a person into criminal or otherwise ill-advised
pursuit. ""When you think of people who were friends at
Enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support
antisocial behavior."" 

Betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""When friends
split up,"" said Dr. Keith E. Davis, a professor of
psychology at the University of South Carolina, ""it is
often in cases where one has shared personal information or
secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential.""


Another form of betrayal, Dr. Yager said, is when a friend
suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""It's
more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""The silent
treatment is actually malicious."" 

At least as devastating is an affair with the friend's
romantic partner, as recently happened to one of Dr.
Lerner's patients. ""I would not encourage her to hang in
there and work this one out,"" Dr. Lerner said. 

A third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults
the other person, Dr. Yager said. One of the 180 people who
responded to Dr. Yager's most recent survey on friendship
described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her
""a derogatory name."" The woman, now 32, was so devastated
that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with
people ever since, Dr. Yager said. 

Emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse,
but it is ""more insidious,"" Dr. Yager said. ""Some people
constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""They'll
have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or
she finds out."" 

Risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme
kinds of bad friends, Dr. Yager said, but they are not the
only ones. She identifies 21 different varieties. Occupying
the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is
overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person
who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and
the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. 

Most common is the promise breaker. ""This includes everyone
from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but
something always comes up at the last minute to someone who
promises to be there for you when you need them, but then
isn't,"" Dr. Yager said. 

Some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do,
when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons
to dislike the other one. 

""With couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to
discover there's something important they don't like about
the other person,"" said Dr. Rose of Florida International.
""One might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other
person is a racist. In friendships, which are less intense,
it may take even more time for one person to meet the
other's dislike criteria."" 

Whether a friendship is worth saving, Dr. Lerner said,
""depends on how large the injury is."" 

""Sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let
something go,"" she added. ""It's also an act of maturity
sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" 

Acceptance should come easier among friends than among
spouses, Dr. Lerner said, because people have more than one
friend and do not need a full range of emotional support
from each one. 

But if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where
one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the
friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is
to pull away, Dr. Yager said, to stop sharing the personal
or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to
get together, ever. 

""It takes two people to start and maintain a friendship,
but only one to end it,"" Dr. Yager said. 

Friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far
easier to dissolve than marriage. But it is also
comparatively fragile, experts say. Ideally, the loss of a
bad friendship should leave a person with more time and
appreciation for good ones, Dr. Lerner said. 

""It is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have
them in order while you're healthy and your life and work
are going well,"" she said. ""Because when a crisis hits,
when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your
health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash
course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and
life-preserving good friendship is.""

I love this business.  If a bridge falls over, the architect or the

(more often) the people walking on it.

Ours is the /only/ industry that can hold itself 100% un-responsible
for any and all sloth-inflicted doom, and the only industry which can
/also/ get away with feeding this myth of infallibility unquestioned
to the media, to investors, to students and to each other.

   ""God I hate telephones.  Telephones are stupid. I used a telephone
   to, like, call my broker yesterday, and y'know, just /after/ I'd
   ordered those 2000 shares of Nortel ...""

You just gotta love a mass-delusion like that.

Although it's like a total shock to 99.999% (5nines) of all the
employed website designers out there, the truth is webforms /can/
accept ""U.S. of A"" as a country.  Incredible, but true.  Web forms can
also accept /multiple/ or even /free-form/ telephone numbers and can
even be partitioned into manageable steps. All this can also be done
without selling exclusive rights to your wallet to the World's
Second-Richest Corporation (assuming Cisco is still #1) and vendor
locking your business into their ""small transaction fee"" tithe.

Of course, try and tell one of those 5-niners that and they'll get all
defensive, black list you as a sh*t disturber and undermine your
reputation with the boss...  not that I'm speaking first-hand or
anything ;)

Slaughter in the Name of God,"First, it was my understanding that they had the food before they
refused to pay.  I often have the goods in my possession before I settle
the paycheck.

Second, 'not being paid for a little food' is an awfully big deal in
India.  It isn't far from stealing the only food my children have so
I'll have to watch them starve.  The margin of survival is very, very,
thin.

So yes.  In my particular reality distortion field 'not paying for a
little food' in India is akin to a direct act of violence intended to
cause suffering if not death on the victims family.  That such an act
triggers a violent response is, IMHO, hardly surprising.

In other words, as far as I could tell the people on the train fired the
first shot.

With all of that said I still don't know if this happened or not.  Nor
do I know for sure that the margin of survival for those Muslim vendors
was that thin.

That is a fully retarded view of economics, and pretty much the same kind
of clueless oversimplication that led to the blackouts.  There are a
bazillion factors that affect game strategies, which is what the state of
California messed up and the energy producers exploited.

I'm not convinced that the only way to prevent future energy debacles like
the blackouts is to reregulate.  Ultimately we have to blame the people
who crafted the game rules in a way that invited blackouts and
exploitation.  Given that the particular set of rules crafted by the state
of California sucked, does there exist a set of rules that doesn't suck?  
If there does exist a better set of rules, then reregulation isn't
necessarily the answer.

You can't blame businesses for being profit maximizers.  Yes, the people 
involved were heartless and corrupt.  But mainly they just did their 
jobs.

The guilty parties are either the mathematicians and economists who wrote
the rules or, if the mathematicians and economists said there were no good
rules, pro-deregulation politicians who went ahead anyway.

Hmmm... I don't see any :-)

My main concern is that when rebuilding the recent packages I've made for
Psyche on Valhalla, I'd need to lower the ""Release:"" tag (to keep an
upgrade working), and that would f*ck up my CVS repository which is on my
Valhalla box (well, I'm exagerating, It'll just make it more difficult for

Sure, there are easy ways around this, but the easiest for me will be to
wait until I upgrade my main box to Psyche and have Valhalla only on a

Indeed, my usual login is ""dude"" (and has been since long before ""The Big

my home directory when being compiled :-(
For instance :

The interesting thing is that these hits all seem to be rot13 versions
of the To: address.  If we ever start getting FPs (or if anyone is
worried), we could make it an eval test for rot13 of the To: address
(turning non-word characters into ""."" characters in the regular
expression).

At the same time, it might be worth testing for username in HTML
comments.  I found some <!--quinlan--> types in HTML comments, but I
haven't seen enough hits so far to bother (however, I did add a really
good test for email addresses in comments).

Secure Sofware Key,"the only way to insure a safe key is to use all the storage space in the
universe. too big to decrypt.

my point is there will never be a ""safe"" key. what I would consider is how
long does the data need to be protected. if you need to protect the data for
longer than 6 months, do not release it to the public. if you are trying to
stop the general public (your customer) from coping the data then use what
is available on the market. If you want to stop the bootleggers do not
release the data to the public.

I have never seen a lock that could not be unlocked. the act of unlocking
the key gives away it's secret.

the tougher the lock the more pissed-off your customers will be. take MS-XP
for example. only the home user is forced to register. think of the
nightmare if business had to register every copy. how many times have we
needed to reinstall our laptop OS? notice the amount of Mac's sold after the
XP release. these where mostly home users that converted to Mac OS.

the new Audio CD's that have digital copy protection so not play on my
computer. does this stop me from copying the CD? no. however it does make me
return them and get my money back.

the more popular the software the more likely it is to be cracked.

Now, to do this, we all know they have to be cracking the strong crypto used

Or.... you could just not bloat it 20x to begin with. Nah! (that was the
whole point of XML afterall, to sell more CPUs - much like Oracle's use of
Java allows them to sell 3x more CPU licenses due to the performance hit)

Your sysadmins are wrong.

Whatever program that is used to store the mail into the 
braindead ""mailbox"" file (/var/spool/mail/whatever) is supposed 
to escape a line that begins with From.  That program is called 
the local Mail Delivery Agent (MDA)

It would be better if you never, ever, stored your mail in a 
""mailbox"" file.

If your sysadmins are capable of it, get them to set up the 
receiving Mail Transfer Agent (MTA) to allow the use of procmail 
as the local MDA.  Then use procmail to invoke rcvstore and 
deliver your mail directly into your MH mail folders.

Most Linux systems come configured this way, if a user has a
$HOME/.procmail file then mail is delivered using procmail.

Can someone please tell me what a ""pitch"" constitutes? I have an idea

------------------
Just an area of the beach by the prom where he's allowed to make his

Weymouth is where I spent my teenage years. My mum and one sister still live
there.
So I'm pretty familiar with the sculptures; pretty impressive, and very big.
(I think he uses some sort of armature for some bits - it's not just sand)
They usually get vandalised, though; after a lot of drinks, it obviously is
a good idea to break into the enclosure and kick all the sculptures to bits.
Then again, Weymouth is pretty run down, and attracts holiday makers of the
worst sort.

Incredibly creative, in my opinion. Not terribly violent (I mean, how

Well, my point is more that we should aim our rescoring algorithm so that
a spam hits 5.0.    Any higher does us no good, as it means an FP is
a lot harder to recover from, using compensation rules.

Spams *will* hit higher than that -- that's just the way the scoring works.
but for our code to be effective, and spread the range of scores
correctly, we just have to optimise to hit 1 threshold.

en window versus Sequences Window,"
I apologize for not catching up to the current code in so long.

Now that I have I'm trying to resolve ""breakage"" and differences.

The unseen window seems to have been replaced with the sequences 
window.  While I appreciate the flexibility of the sequences 
window, the unseen window filled an important-to-me need:  It 
was tiny and could be set to show on all desktops of a virtual 
window manager without taking a lot of space.  Since my normal 
mode of operation involves two copies of exmh displaying on a 
1024x768 vnc session, screen space is at a premium.

As things stand now, I have a sequences window that shows a lot
more information than I need to have handy and takes up a lot 
more room than I can ""spare"".

I can see that I could like the new sequences window a lot for 
certain operations.  But I'd like a nice uncluttered, tiny 
window that _only_ shows me info on my unread mail.

One possibility that occurs to me would be a button or mouse
click that ""shrinks"" the Sequences window to show only the
sequences in the ""always show"" list.  And of course a way to 
expand it back.

zteana] Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected,"The Electronic Telegraph

 Six arrested for attacking Palio jockey who defected 
 By Bruce Johnston in Rome
 (Filed: 28/08/2002) 
 
 
 Police waded into the intrigues and enmities surrounding the Palio, Siena's
 traditional bareback horse race, for the first time yesterday, arresting six
 people for beating up a star jockey who defected to a rival team.
 
 
 Angry spectators attack Giuseppe Pes at the Palio horse race in Siena 
 Giuseppe Pes, a champion jockey of Sardinian extraction who has won the Palio
 nine times in 38 runs, was closely associated with the Istrice, or Porcupine,
 contrada - section of town - until the race earlier this month.
 
 Istrice did not have a horse in the contest - only 10 of the 17 contradas take
 part in each Palio - but, despite promises to the contrary, moments before the
 off Mr Pes mounted the horse of Lupa, or She-Wolf.
 
 Lupa are Istrice's historic rivals, and the defection was not taken well. Lupa
 did not win, victory going instead to Tartuca, tortoise.
 
 As its supporters erupted into joyous celebrations, Mr Pes was pulled from his
 mount by Istrice members and savagely beaten and kicked for seven minutes.
 
 Mr Pes, 39, whose jacket with his contrada's colours was torn from his back,
 was sent to hospital with fractures, cuts and bruises.
 
 Three of his attendants who tried to intervene were also beaten. Police
 yesterday arrested six people they said had been identified as the attackers
 from video footage.
 
 Experts said it was the first time that members of a contrada - known as
 contradaioli - had been arrested for beating up a jockey, despite the fact
 that such episodes belong to the race's ancient traditions.
 
 The Palio, which was first raced in the 14th century, is held twice a year on
 the cobbles of Siena's main square. For weeks beforehand supporters parade
 through the city, singing, waving flags and wearing their contrada colours.
 But by the day of the race the good humour evaporates.
 
 The event has no rules and is prepared for and run amid an extraordinary
 undercurrent of intrigue and even violence. Jockeys may swap sides at the last
 minute, take bribes, and whip rivals' horses, and more, so long as they do not
 grab their reins.
 
 The origins of the contrada lie in the Middle Ages, when the neighbourhoods'
 boundaries were set out to aid the many mercenary companies hired to defend
 Siena's fiercely earned independence from Florence and other city states.
 
 The first Palio of the year takes place on July 2, to commemorate the miracles
 of the Madonna of Provenzano, and a second race on Aug 16 marks the feast of
 the Assumption of the Virgin.

sprint delivers the next big thing??,"i agree with rob. i think if the phones (and mms is building traction in europe in handsets), this might be interesting. bottom line is will it a) help sell phones and b) bill enough time on the wcarriers networks?

anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography - developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch - more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them.

Just a big *thank you* to Chris for being willing to dive in and get
very messy.  The sequence management code is some of the very oldest
in exmh, and surely suffered as features were added over several years.
When this stabilizes, it will be a great excuse for a 2.6 release.

and it looks like PPP for USD 33k is only

Australia	 A$3.00 USD 1.62	-35%

Shelley Powers raises[1] some interesting questions re whether RDF has a place 
in syndication. She says that RDF is trying to build a persistent database (aka 
the Semantic Web) and RSS is trying to flow news that has a short lifespan. I 
had not heard this point before. It's worth thinking about.

Anolther sequence related traceback,"You can also duplicate thiswith

MsgChange - noshow

at the Tcl prompt in the Log window.  I suspect that the sequence
parser, which understands things like 5-22 to mean messages 5 through 22
is confused when asked to add/remove message ""-"" from a sequence.

If we are allowed to assume 8.2 or higher, which we can't really, then
we could add

if {![string is integer $select(sel)]} {
   # bail out of message select mode
}
to the SelectTypein procedure.

We can probably survive with

if {![regexp {^[0-9]+$} $select(sel)]} {
    #bail out of message select mode

I'm surprised to not find this phenomenon in Corlis. I could have sworn I
saw it there. He does have the somewhat similar dark sky between a rainbow
and a secondary bow. I personally have seen a rainbow enclosing a
semi-circle of darker sky.

I know I've read about pillars under the Sun and Moon elsewhere, but I can't
recall if they were reportedly dark or bright. I do know these sorts of
things are supposed to be quirks of optics not of the visual system. I'm
sorry I haven't got any answers, but a search through some books on
atmospheric optics ought to turn a few hints up.

Status: RO
Subject: [dgc.chat] First public release of NeuDist Distributed Transaction
Clearing	Framework

Reply-To: <dgcchat@lists.goldmoney.com>

I'm happy to announce the first public release of NeuDist

NeuDist is an Open Source Software framework for building applications
for the Neubia Distributed Clearing Platform.

This release contains early java libraries and documentation that would
primarily be of interest to developers.

Talking about documentation, it is still a bit slim and mainly oriented
towards people with experience in Java/XML development.

There are currently no sample applications, but they will be available
in the next release.

The framework currently contains the following:
- Classes for creating ""Named Objects"", which are authenticated using
digital signatures within a hierarchy.
- Storage framework for ""Named Objects"".
- Simple XML-Signature implementation (Almost certainly not yet
interoperable with other implementations)
- Simple SOAP client
- Simple Servlet API for handling SOAP requests based on ""Named
  Objects"".
- Current types of ""Named Objects"" include:
    NameSpace objects -- for maintaining the NameSpace Authentication
 	Framework
    AuthenticationTickets -- for doing web site authentication using
	digital signatures.


Next major release is scheduled to contain:
 - Core:
	hard coded root public key, for authenticating top level 	NameSpaces
 - Signing Services:
	Implementation of web based signing services
	End user hosted signing service
 - Example User Authentication Application
 - Example Payment System based on NeuDist

I will be expanding the documentation over the next few weeks. This will
cover not only more indepth technical documentation, but also higher
level documentation about the business side of things.

Read more about NeuDist or download our early version at
http://neudist.org
I would love to hear your questions and suggestions. To discuss it

t census,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85519849
Date: Not supplied

A new census of the world's robot population reveals disturbing negative robot 
population growth, but still, our fleshless offspring's numbers point to a 
machinery future: 

    Some 20,000 domestic-help robots were sold worldwide last year, half 
    designed to mow lawns. Vacuum-cleaning robots were introduced late in 2001 
    and a study in Sweden found that 5,000 were sold in the last two months of 
    the year. Window-cleaning robots are set to boom, said the U.N. study.

CD player UI for toddlers,"
Our preschoolers (2 and 4) use Winamp with a Pokemon skin.  It's the
2-yr-old who figured out he could put it into a sidebar menu so all
he need do is click there to launch their favourite MP3 playlist.

What /we/ need is a good ""barely literate"" email program.  Years ago
the university of Hawaii had a word processor that included a
voice-assist and also would pop up menus for common completions as
words were typed; even further back there was a DOS shareware editor
that did that latter function extremely well (targetted at the
handicapped).  With just those little bits of assists, maybe some
clever use of pictograms too, I bet kindergarten kids could handle
email.

Its a little confusing but you install rpms like
rpm -ivh packagename-0.1.1.rpm 
uninstalls must be done without the version info like
rpm -e packagename   ie: rpm -e sendmail or

Something like that is quite possible, but perviously typing nonsense

Scripting languages allow rapid development of game behavior without the 
pitfalls that await the unwary C++ programmer. Using an existing scripting 
language saves the time and cost of developing a custom language, and typically 
gives you a far more powerful language than you could create on your own. 
Python is an excellent choice for a game scripting language because it is 
powerful, easily embedded, can seamlessly be extended with C/C++ code

I think that is directly from openssh site. It's from the RH 6.2 that I 
upgraded to 7.2 (6.2 doesn't ship with openssh...). 

I probably should downgrade to the versoin RH provides except I can't do

A lot of spam which *appears* to originate from China, and even 
a lot which advertises websites hosted there, is sent by, and is 
done for the benefit of, companies based in the US.  The spam 
often appears to originate there because it's coming from open 
http, or squid proxy servers.  It's hosted there because these 
spammers are now persona-non-grata on all US ISPs.  One hardly 
needs to involve the Chinese government in a case where a US 
citizen is violating US law.

The first court cases were actually concluded years ago. These 
include many legal precedents which are used to protect the 
rights of ISPs to block mail, and to terminate service to 
spammers.

Surprising then, how much information you can find on the 
current whereabouts of long-time spammers like Alan Ralksy of 
Detroit, Michigan.  Ralsky is a guy who even gives interviews to 
the news media.  If you can connect a specific corpus of spam to 
him, his street address is well known. Ralsky is a prime 
candidate for lawsuits in any state with an anti-spam law. 
Thomas Cowles is another long-time spammer, but last I heard 
he'd been jailed for stealing computer equipment from his 
business partner, Eddy Marin (also a long time spammer (You've 
heard of PopLaunch, right?)

Back when I was working at MAPS, there was a flap over a 
pump-and-dump spammer, Rodona Garst.  Seems she had an open 
file-share on her laptop, and when she forged the wrong domain, 
the real owner hacked in and posted all her private information 
on a website. Oh, look, it's still there, including the nude 
photos:

http://belps.freewebsites.com/

I recall this well, because the SEC was VERY interested in 
confirming the validity of the information found online.  There 
were some ""interesting"" conversations. This summer, the SEC 
released the following:

http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin/33-8113.htm

Yes, the investigation took two years, but the financial penalty 
for operating a pump-and-dump scam isn't small.  The wheels of 
government grind slow, but the grind very fine indeed.

> good thing?

Since I don't know what you did, exactly, I can't guess.  What you seemed to
show is that you did *something* clever with headers and that doing so
helped (the ""after"" numbers are better than the ""before"" numbers, right?).
Assuming that what you did was override what's now
tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers with some other routine, and didn't
call the base Tokenizer.tokenize_headers at all, then you're missing
carefully tested treatment of just a few header fields, but adding many
dozens of other header fields.  There's no question that adding more header
fields should help; tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers doesn't do so only
because my testing corpora are such that I can't add more headers without
getting major benefits for bogus reasons.

Apart from all that, you said you're skipping Received.  By several
accounts, that may be the most valuable of all the header fields.  I'm
(meaning tokenizer.Tokenizer.tokenize_headers) skipping them too for the
reason explained above.  Offline a week or two ago, Neil Schemenauer
reported good results from this scheme:

    ip_re = re.compile(r'(\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3}\.\d{1,3})')

    for header in msg.get_all(""received"", ()):
        for ip in ip_re.findall(header):
            parts = ip.split(""."")
            for n in range(1, 5):
                yield 'received:' + '.'.join(parts[:n])

This makes a lot of sense to me; I just checked it in, but left it disabled
for now.

usually i use a relatively secure tool called 'quintuple agent'

and i've just added the few lines of code to exmh which allow for such
external caches.

the patch is attached, it is against version 2.5-1 (debian), and the
files modified are extrasInit.tcl and pgpExec.tcl.

i've added three new preferences in the 'general pgp' section, which
allow everybody to use his/her favourite external tool to get the
passphrase (everything which spits out the phrase on stdout is ok).

i'd be happy if somebody with cvs access thinks that this stuff 
is worth to be added and does so; apart from that i'm happy for 
suggestions, comments or critique (mind you, i'm not exactly a special

zteana] Betamax finally laid to rest,"Not fortean, but a moment in time all the same...

http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/2220972.stm


Betamax video recorders are finally being phased out almost 20 years after
losing the battle for dominance of the home video market to VHS. 
Betamax's manufacturer, Sony, has announced that it will make only 2,000
more machines for the Japanese market. 

They have not been on sale in the rest of the world since 1998. 

 
VHS became the dominant format by the mid-1980s
 
Betamax was launched in 1975, and won many fans who said it was better
quality than its VHS rival. 

Some 2.3 million Betamax machines were sold worldwide in its peak year,
1984, but it soon went downhill as VHS became the format of choice for the
film rental industry and in homes. 

Just 2,800 machines were sold in the 12 months to March 2002. 

""With digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the
market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to
secure parts,"" Sony said in a statement. 

Sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the
format. 

The professional Betamax format, Betacam, is still widely used in the
television and film industries and will be unaffected. 

But the recent rise of DVDs seems to have put the final nail in the coffin
for Betamax home players. 

In the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the VHS format. 

Betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of
competition from VHS that they set up the Betaphile Club in 1988. 

The picture and sound quality of Beta was superior to VHS, Betaphiles say,
although VHS tapes had a longer duration. 

A total of 18 million Betamax machines were sold around the world, but no
new ones will be made after the end of 2002. 

Sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies.

I suspect that as part of Chris' set of changes, he cleaned up the
use of the variable that was named ""L"" in FtocCommit (in ftoc.tcl).
Its name got changed from L to lineno

But there's one reference of $L left.   That causes tracebacks if
you attempt to use ""link"" with the current CVS version of exmh.

I guess that most of us don't use ""link"" very often ... I noticed it
last week, but only got time to look and see why today.

If someone with the ability to commit to the CVS repository would
apply the following patch (to lib/ftoc.tcl) that would be nice.
(It works... and is trivial, and you could perhaps just apply it by
making the change with an editor faster than saving this patch and
applying it - there's only one instance of $L in the file, that
should be changed to $lineno)

In my experience, they do care.  It has to work certainly, and in
particular it has to work with what they've already got, and it has to
work on client's systems.

My limited experience of Java started a few years ago when support on
Linux was so terrible that I ran away screaming and haven't come back yet.

Microsoft has announced that they plan to remove Java from Windows.
They took it out of XP already and it has to be installed with a
service pack.  Somehow, I can't imagine them removing the ability to
run C programs.

If your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve,
then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language.

You appear to be gratuitously asserting that C programmers waste time
on irrelevant low-level problems and Java programmers don't.  Depends
entirely on the programmer, not the language.

Buzzword.

Unsupported assertion.

Dunno.  E.g., I ported a wee 15000-line C program to Darwin on PowerPC
in a few minutes yesterday.  Sure if it was badly designed it would be
10 times the size and harder to port.  If it depended on unavailable
libraries it would be much harder.  Portable code is easy to port.
At least that is the case when then language you used is available on
the target platform: I also run on ARM systems with no proper Java.

You can pay a good programmer to solve your problem now, or else get
some kids to hack spaghetti Fortran in any language and then pay for
maintenance headaches ad infinitum.

Whoah!!!  Performance matters to me every day.  (Right now I'm taking
time out to write email while waiting for a job to run).  Sure I could
wait 5 years until everyone's PC is fast enough to generate random EC's
in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code
that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors,
or I can do it now when very few people can.

Yes.

It's true!  I admit everything!  Mea maxima culpa!  Working in C makes
me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hard-core bitography!
Not.

Actually I spend most of my time thinking in high-level mathematics.


>Why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems

Dunno, and frankly I don't see the relevance to the issue at hand.


I'm sure Java is fine for some stuff, as is C or whatever.  Horses for
courses.

But Colossus was not for Enigma. The bombes used for Enigma were
electro-mechanical. I'm not aware of any application of optical techniques
to Enigma, unless they were done in the US and are still classified. And
clearly, the first bulk breaks of Enigma were done by the bombes, so I
guess it depends whether you count bombes as computers or not, whether this
statement has any credibility at all.

./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/url/url --exec-prefix=/url/url
followed by the commands make and make install.
There is no text files which contain help on installing the url package so

Horrors. Applets are kinda sucky. The cool kids are using Java to write
server applications, not browser craplets.

The giggle-inducing irony of the whole Java thing is how Sun's strategy
backfired. They produced a platform that was supposed to dwell on the
client side, where it would commoditize those clients. Instead, it turns
out to be the perfect language to write server applications in, and it has
successfully commoditized servers. Ooops!

There has been a significant recent increase in global CO2 concentrations.
The vast preponderance of the new CO2 in the atmosphere is due to human
activity starting around the industrialization of Europe, and accelerating
after WWII. Most scientists studying global climate change believe that
these increased CO2 concentrations are the primary causal agent for
increased global warming. Hence our interest in items of human time scale.

Most global climate change scientists would agree that temperatures in the
past have often been much warmer than today. The point of global warming
isn't to save the Earth -- the planet is not sentient. The point is to
understand and potentially reduce the impact of increasing temperatures on
global human activity.

The increase in atmospheric CO2 concentration is due to human activity.

It is generally accepted that increases in CO2 in a closed environment
subject to solar heating retain more of that solar energy. This is the
current best explanation for the high temperature of Venus. If the CO2
concentration goes up globally (which it has), then theory states the earth
should be retaining greater solar energy. This process may be slow, and may
be difficult to monitor due to the variability of temperatures worldwide. I
encourage you to refute any part of this causal chain linking CO2 to
eventual increases in global energy content, part of which will be evident
as heat.

ributed.net cracks the RC5-64 cipher,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85512053
Date: Not supplied

The Distributed.net project -- a precursor to SETI@Home that used volunteer 
computer-time to attack giant, sophisticated ciphers -- has cracked RC564. I 
used to have half a dozen computers working on this. 

    On 14-Jul-2002, a relatively characterless PIII-450 in Tokyo returned the 
    winning key to the distributed.net keyservers. The key 0x63DE7DC154F4D039 
    produces the plaintext output: 

    The unknown message is: some things are better left unread 

    Unfortunately, due to breakage in scripts (dbaker's fault, naturally) on 
    the keymaster, this successful submission was not automatically detected. 
    It sat undiscovered until 12-Aug-2002. The key was immediately submitted to 
    RSA Labs and was verified as the winning key.

SmartCards do not have fixed clock rates (more often than not) as the ISO spec 
dictates that they are externally powered and clocked, but SmartCards used 
for security purposes (usually JavaCards) have built-in crypto co-processors 
that make clock rate irrelevant. 4mhz SmartCards can often preform triple-DES 
faster than general purpose processors clocked at ten times the speed.

That said, clock rate has nothing with how trustworthy a card is. As Michael 
pointed out, there's something of an arms-race between manufacturers and 
attackers which has nothing to do with clock rate, and time and time again 
what we've seen is that it's not a question of ""is it secure"", it's a 
question of ""who is it secure from and for how long?"" Security is rarely a 
question of absolutes (despite the often boolean nature of a break), rather 
it's a question of assessing, quantifying, and managing risk. SmartCards are 
designed to address threats in which the cost of protection cannot exceed the 
$1-20 range (depending on the application).

As whether or not they are ""trusted hardware"", the question again revolves 
around attacker and timeframe. One might expect a bored undergrad EE student 
to have more trouble revealing the contents of a pilfered smartcard than, 
say, a governtment intelligence service. If your goal is to keep undergrad 
EEs from perpetrating mass fraud in the caffeteria, then a smartcard is 
likely ""trustworthy"" enough for your application. If your aim is to protect 
ICBM launch codes, then it's probably the wrong tool. In either application, 
a risk/cost ratio must justify the use of the protection measure in question.

	When I do that, it just moves my mouse to the very edge of a window
(probably trying to center it on the off-screen window in question.) 

	I'll have to try it with another window manager and see if I can
get exmh to put it back inside of sane boundaries. I don't have this

 Just to solve this...the reason I was booting the box with
root=/dev/hda5, not /dev/md0 was because /dev/md0 wasn't booting - it
would barf with 'can't find init'.

 It turns out that this is because I was populating md0 with tar. Which
seems to have 'issues' with crosslinked files - for instance, it was
trying to make a hard link of glibc.so to hda - and failing. It was only
as I did it again with a friend present, that he spotted the errors, and
queried them. We noticed that the hard linked files just didn't exist on
the new rootfs.

 When we duplicated the filesystems with dump instead of tar, it worked
fine, I was able to tell lilo to use root=/dev/md0 and everything worked.

 Woohoo.

nial Script ...,"Oh, they were plenty upset about the tea taxes.

But the crack down on colonial script certainly screwed over the
American Colonies.  And, BTW, England as well.

Dear Ben Franklin was right for the wrong reasons.  First of all the
colonies were not prosperous compared to England proper.  Second, the
issuance of colonial script had nothing to do with full employeement.

(In fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim.  It
sounds like a modern Keynsian was creating an urban legend.)

OTOH the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was
economically crippling.  Imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering
IOUs on your own name -- and then trying to market / exchange the paper
as the merchant who took the IOU.

===========================

The most common problem in the world is when a government prints too
much money.  The effects are a complete disaster.  There are a lot of
incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is
incredibly stupid.

So almost all the literature talks about that.

But you can ALSO screw an economy over by taking all the money out of
circulation.  The fundamental cause of the American Great Depression was
exactly this, courtesy of the Federal Reserve Board.

I don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of Canada
had much effect.  And Canada is still a prosperous country.

Considering 90% of the fake job posting I see are for embedded systems or

The problem is the problem you're trying to solve is never the same. Java
will soon suffer API-rot (alot of poeple are already complaining about it),
it's just new. C was clean in the beginning too. API-rot is PURELY a
function of age.

I do this all the time, It's alot easier then you think if the original
programmer had a clue at all... Java does remove the clue requirement tho,
just adds a huge testing requirement, QA guys aren't as cheap ;)

No it's not, but you can hire teams of Javites for cheap at your local high
school. Java is about cutting costs and commoditizing programming - and it's
working!

Hat 8.0,"Hi,

Red Hat 8.0 is released tomorrow (monday).  I took some time out to make 
RPMs of GStreamer for it.

All of them (core, plugins and player) have been uploaded to the apt 
repository in a new ""redhat-80-i386"" directory.

The repository for dependencies is again called ""deps"", and the one for 
the gstreamer rpms is ""redhat"", because this time around the base distro 
contains all the necessary packages.

A screenshot of Red Hat 8.0 running gst-player is up at
http://thomas.apestaart.org/download/screenshots/redhat-80-gst-player.png


Here are some known issues with the resulting rpms :

a) gstreamer-nautilus isn't built, the package got renamed and I don't 
have a -devel package for it yet

b) the c++ plugins have problems which I haven't been able to resolve.
Here are the errors:

INFO (15299: 0)gst_xml_registry_rebuild:1555: Plugin 
/usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so failed to load: Error loading plugin 
/usr/lib/gst/libgstwincodec.so, reason: /usr/lib/libaviplay-0.7.so.0:

I'm not sure how to fix this; running strings on the libs in /usr/lib 
reveals that there are other libs that have these symbols, so there must 
be something straightforward that should fix this.
If anyone has a suggestion, please share ;)

ral defnitions,"Depends on how much over spending vs. how much (and what type) over
regulation.

The biggest problem with over regulation is the costs can be invisible.
It also has the ability to single out particular people, while over
spending spreads the damage more evenly.  Rent control would be an
example of a regulation solution that is in general worse than spending
tons of money on public housing.

As for the definition of a liberal being someone who seeks to impose
both, I find no fault in that definition whatsoever.  The opinion that
EITHER we are spending too much OR we have too much regulation is pretty
much anathema to liberal politics.

Finally, those who argue that there are private replacements for much
government regulation are not saying that a state of nature (no private
replacements, no government regulation) is better than government
regulation itself.

And in my experience people who label themselves 'Green' (which does not
include everyone who loves trees and thinks smokestacks are ugly) is a
watermelon.

AA Meetings the Hottest Place to Meet Women With Big Bucks,"Gary Lawrence Murphy:
>OK, but only if you also meant religious and alcoholic extremes ;)

Since it was my quip, I'll point out that I used
the term ""alcoholism,"" implying addiction. I
drink. I'm not an alcoholic. Most people who drink
don't go to AA meetings. Most people who go to AA
meetings do (try very hard) not to drink.

As to religion, I think it is harmful and risky in
almost any degree. Were I single, I might consider
potential mates who partook of the less irrational
or more light-hearted religions. A Unitarian or
Buddhist might be an example of the first, a Wiccan
of the second. But someone who is both irrational
and serious about that irrationality strikes me as
a bad choice of partner, moreso than someone who
was addicted to some drug. Alcoholics and drug
addicts at least have the sense to battle their
problem, and to keep their children from suffering
it. The religious revel in their irrationality,
and want to raise their children in it. That's a
difficult difference for two parents to
reconcile.

Fortunately, I am long and happily enamored of
someone who has no religious tendencies.

HHS Seeks Science Advice to Match Bush Views

By Rick Weiss
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, September 17, 2002; Page A01

The Bush administration has begun a broad restructuring of the
scientific advisory committees that guide federal policy in areas such
as patients' rights and public health, eliminating some committees
that were coming to conclusions at odds with the president's views and
in other cases replacing members with handpicked choices.

Thanks for the script.  It also appears that the standard logrotate tools
included with many systems (or at least RedHat systems) will support
wildcards when rotating files so something like
/home/*/.razor/razor-agent.log can be specified...

better yet would be a built-in server check on a periodic basis, even
daily, looking for the existence of an update, and if found prompt the
system admin to upgrade the server.  With the ever changing face of spam,
this would probably be a big benefit to SA users and help keep everyone up
to date.  We have not done this with too many of the apps we sell on
www.RoseCitySoftware.com strictly because of joe-average-user concerns
about spyware and ""phoning home"", but in cases where the app needs to
access the internet anyhow, we have done it with great success and minimal
concern by our users.

Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...),"
Related anecdote:

I was eating in a restaurant in chinatown in Boston.  The place was empty.  
The only other customer was a white guy reading an asian-language 
newspaper.  The guy asked the waiter for help translating a word.  
Eventually his story came out.

He had married an asian woman through one of these introduction services.  
after about a year of marriage she had charged him with assault and left
him, leaving no contact information.  He was hanging around in Chinatown,
asking random asians for help finding her.

I obviously don't know if he did assault her, but what struck me was that
the possibility of mutual exploitation is high.

Anecdote number two:

In college I had a job as a street vendor.  There was a guy I worked with
who was a lifer in the job.  He was a noticably messed up guy.  Among
other odd characteristics he fawned on women customers, doing stuff like
offering them flowers.

I asked him about it.  He said that he'd never had sex with a woman who
wasn't a prostitute, and his dream was to save up enough money to get a
mail order bride.

I was really moved.  The guy was a loon, but he wanted a companion as much
as anyone else and he was realistic about his chances.

I'm not sure they are doing strictly help-desk stuff.
But the whole 'who in their right mind would use that? it doesn't have all
these cool features!' isn't always a guarantee of failure - maybe there is a
strength in this approach (agents and/or IM as ui) than can find a nich

What about a situation where you don't directly ask/talk to the bot, but
they listen in and advise/correct/interject/etc?
example: two people discussing trips, etc. may trigger a weather bot to

Answering that requires fairly complete knowledge of the business
model. But, in all probability: no, it isn't usually worth it. So, it
comes down to how difficult you want to make the cracker's job.

If the product requires occasional authentication, simple copying
won't work; the product has to be cracked. In which case, the issue is
whether you're actually going to enter into battle with the crackers,
or just make sure that it isn't trivial.

A lot of it comes down to your customer base. Teenage kids tend to be
more concerned about cost and less concerned about viruses/trojans,
and so more willing to use warez. Fortune-500 corporations are likely
to view matters differently.

> Does it really make it more secure ?

Yes; software techniques will only get you so far. Actually, the same
is ultimately true for hardware, but cracking hardware is likely to
require resources other than just labour.

Almost (?) anything can be reverse engineered. But it may be possible
to ensure that doing so is uneconomical.

> Look at the DVDs.

IIRC, CSS was cracked by reverse-engineering a software player; and
one where the developers forgot to encrypt the decryption key at that.

s about sex.,"
Forwarded-by: Flower

Did you know that you can tell from the skin whether a person is
sexually active or not?

1. Sex is a beauty treatment. Scientific tests find that when woman
   make love they produce more of the hormone estrogen, which makes
   hair shiny and skin smooth.

2. Gentle, relaxed lovemaking reduces your chances of suffering
   dermatitis, skin rashes and blemishes. The sweat produced cleanses
   the pores and makes your skin glow.

3. Lovemaking can burn up those calories you piled on during that
   romantic dinner.

4. Sex is one of the safest sports you can take up. It stretches
   and tones up just about every muscle in the body. It's more enjoyable
   than swimming 20 laps, and you don't need special sneakers!

5. Sex is an instant cure for mild depression. It releases the body
   endorphin into the bloodstream, producing a sense of euphoria and
   leaving you with a feeling of well-being.

6. The more sex you have, the more you will be offered. The sexually
   active body gives off greater quantities of chemicals called
   pheromones.  These subtle sex perfumes drive the opposite sex crazy!

7. Sex is the safest tranquilizer in the world. IT IS 10 TIMES MORE
   EFFECTIVE THAN VALIUM.

8. Kissing each day will keep the dentist away. Kissing encourages
   saliva to wash food from the teeth and lowers the level of the acid
   that causes decay, preventing plaque build-up.

9. Sex actually relieves headaches. A lovemaking session can release
   the tension that restricts blood vessels in the brain.

10. A lot of lovemaking can unblock a stuffy nose. Sex is a national
    antihistamine. It can help combat asthma and hay fever.

ENJOY SEX!

Just one more info. I measured the time spent wrapping the stuff in 
Ftoc_Next with time {} so the data is for real. One difference 
between mine and Valdis' setup (judging from his trace) is that I use 
the address book. I've been doing that for ages so that can't be the 
problem.

Is there a way to get the log to print time with higher granularity?

Isn't it just basically a mixture of beaten egg and bacon (or pancetta,

cooks the egg. That's my understanding.

How were these msgs broken up into the 5 sets?  Set4 in particular is giving
the other sets severe problems, and Set5 blows the f-n rate on everything
it's predicting -- when the rates across runs within a training set vary by
as much as a factor of 25, it suggests there was systematic bias in the way
the sets were chosen.  For example, perhaps they were broken into sets by
arrival time.  If that's what you did, you should go back and break them
into sets randomly instead.  If you did partition them randomly, the wild
variance across runs is mondo mysterious.

Then you have to look at every message by eyeball -- any scheme has non-zero

Trust me <wink> -- it helps a *lot*.  I expect everyone who has done any
testing here has discovered spam in their ham, and vice versa.  Results
improve as you improve the categorization.  Once the gross mistakes are
straightened out, it's much less tedious to scan the rest by eyeball.

For whatever reason, there appear to be few of those in BruceG's spam
collection.  I added code to strip uuencoded sections, and pump out uuencode
summary tokens instead.  I'll check it in.  It didn't make a significant
difference on my usual test run (a single spam in my Set4 is now judged as
ham by the other 4 sets; nothing else changed).  It does shrink the database
size here by a few percent.  Let us know whether it helps you!

There are a few net innovations that have far greater ramifications than you 
would, at first hearing, expect them to. Napster, at heart just IRC with a UI, 
was one. Google News[1] is another. 

In its first day, I've already noticed: 

- The front page changes its editorial stance depending on where the earth's 
terminator[2] is. So in the evening on the West Coast, Google News is lead by 
the South China Morning Post, and various Asian english-language papers. By the 
late evening, the BBC and European papers are kicking in. 
- The site may be created by algorithms - but what about the choice of sites? 
The most arbitrary dividing line I see in Google's coverage is what is a news 
site, and what isn't. Slashdot[3] is, for instance, as well as some very 
obscure[4] newspapers. What about Blues News[5] or Scripting News[6], though? 
- Big companies spend mucho money paying ""clipping services"" that send them 
copies of any press coverage they receive. Clipping services are going to have 
to find some added value, very[7] very[8] quickly.

Well, SpamAssassin will just ignore any old X-Spam-whatever headers
it finds, so that cannot be used to get around the filter.

e/dude,"Hi,

some time now the following messages were haunting me:

     automount[11593]: attempting to mount entry /home/dude

It just came to my attention, that only freshrpm benefitting hosts showed this
up. I grepped through the binaries and found referrences to /home/dude.

I am now relaxed again ;), and pass this info on. Probably Matthias Saou
himself is ""dude"", and some package has hardwired a path in his build

many of the freshrpm suite to narrow it down.

Mixed news from yesterday's heart checkup. 

First, I went seven minutes on the treadmill. That was pretty good. My heart 
was racing like it hadn't since I was in college. They also did an extensive 
ultrasound on my carotid arteries[1], they're in the neck and supply my head 
with blood. More good news there. They're clear, free of plaque, healthy, not 
diseased[2]. So it appears I just have coronary artery disease, not general 
artery disease. That's good because there would be a risk of stroke if they 
were sick, and not a whole lot they can do about it (as they can with the 
heart). 

Now there was some not-good news. A small part of my heart isn't working very 
well. There are a few possible reasons for that, some fixable, some not. I 
asked the doctor, does this mean I'm going to die sooner, and he said no. Does 
it mean I have to restrict what I do, he said no. So what does it mean? Really 
not much, other than I should watch, as before, for recurring symptoms, the 
ones that brought me into the hospital in June. If they come back, we'll do an 
angiogram, and maybe an angioplasty, but the likelihood of another bypass 
because of this is small. That's quite a relief. I don't like the idea of part 
of my heart not working, but what can you do about it?

------- Additional Comments From alan@rdrop.com  2002-09-05 22:22 -------
I haven't tried 2.41 yet because it requires File::Spec, which barfs when
spamassassin tries to use it.  I haven't filed a bug yet because I suspect it's
because I'm still running 5.005 perl because of reported compatibility issues
with 5.6 and later, but I probably will because I think there's too much legacy
perl code to put up with major compatibility problems, and spamassassin didn't,
at least in the quickest of looks, say it needed a newer one.  The perl @ stuff
was bad enough...  but this is all a separate soapbox...

I have seen this ploy (forged From headers) several time since then.
Perhaps the razor-report need to detect this and emit a warning.

As Dan said -- it's a hard corpus, made harder without the spamtrap data.

Also -- and this is an important point -- those measurements can't be
directly compared, because I changed the methodology.  In 2.40 the scores
were evolved on the entire corpus, then evaluated using that corpus; ie.
there was no ""blind"" testing, and the scores could overfit and still
provide good statistics.

In 2.42, they're evaluated ""blind"", on a totally unseen set of messages,
so those figures would be a lot more accurate for real-world use.

Here is the little script I run I run nightly from cron. It does a
general tidying of things including sorting and updating the cache.

I didn't write it and I'm afraid I have lost track of who did, but
it's worked well for years. I run a similar one to update the glimpse
indices nightly.

I just checked out b2_4_0 from CVS and 'make test' fails horribly.

It seems to be looking in my site_perl SpamAssassin code, not the build
directory.

Example error:

Failed to run FROM_AND_TO_SAME_5 SpamAssassin test, skipping:
        (Can't locate object method ""check_for_from_to_same"" via package

Anyone else seeing this?

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments -

Ananova:

Giant horse images 'defaced by hunting activists'

Pro-hunt activists have defaced two of the country's national monuments - 
the two giant white horses - to highlight their cause.



Campaigners for the Real Countryside Alliance say they targeted the two 
images, on hills in Oxfordshire and North Yorkshire, ""to keep the pro-hunt 
thing in the papers"".



Aerial shots show the 374ft-long Bronze Age image on the Berkshire Downs 
near Uffington in Oxfordshire complete with three white hounds and a rider.

In North Yorkshire, a rider in full hunt regalia has been added to the 300ft 
White Horse cut in to the hills at Kilburn, which dates back to the 1700s.

But no-one reported anything to the police.

A spokesman for North Yorkshire police said no reports had been received but 
he had seen ""a red blob"" on the horse and had sent officers to investigate.

In Uffington, no-one in the village had heard anything about the reported 
incident. A spokesman for Thames Valley police said he was not aware of any 
complaints.

Activists say the image in Oxfordshire was drawn in paint used for marking 
lines on grass tennis courts and will wash away in the first rains.

It is not uncommon to find gay males who had sex with several thousands
partners (there would be more, in fact lots more, probably, but a lot of
them have died). Don't have to be a callboy, if considering that you can
have intercourse with several partners in a single day in a bathouse it
doesn't look particularly difficult to do.

Check your local friendly Red Hat installation:

[root@localhost up2date]# rpm --checksig zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm
zsh-4.0.2-2.src.rpm: md5 gpg ok

Of course, this is only as useful as, say, the gpg keys distributed with 
the Kernel tarballs, i.e. if you don't actually bother checking the sig 
then you are open to abuse. It's entirely possible that rpm can be 
configured to require good signatures, but I've not read that part of 
the fine manual just yet.

Actually, you use both.

No, even best supercapacitors are a long way to go from reasonably good 
electrochemical energy sources. But you can recharge and discharge them 
very quickly, and they take lots more of cycles than the best battery. 
Ideal for absorbing the braking energy and turn them into smoking tires 
few moments or minutes afterwards.

I don't see any reason why EVs shouldn't dominate dragster runs. The
traction is the limiting factor, not motor power. You can basically put
the motors into wheelhubs mounted on a composite frame, and dump juice
into them until they melt, which will be some 100 sec downstream. Plenty
of time to smoke anything.

Of course, it doesn't roar, and spew smokage, so it won't happen.

Just remember that the .razor and whatever DCC uses needs to be
world-readable as well.  The solution is then to make a world-writable
log file for at least Razor.  I like symlinking /dev/null myself.

efficient?  probably (depends on the user base), but it also takes

depending again on the user base...)

No, in my opinion, it's purely a bug in SA (or the libraries we use,
which is the same thing) that we don't handle outages of network
services better.

The rule is useful and it does help reduce spam, we should keep it.  I
have a feeling the DNSBL rules will cluster a bit more heavily around
the 1.0 to 2.0 range once we start using the new GA on them.

Also, 0.77 was a slightly conservative number.  Since I didn't have
real-time data, I typically used the lower or median number of different
periods (most recent month, two months, six months), depending on the
trend of the period data (better performance for recent messages ->
favor recent scores, worse performance for recent messages -> favor
lowest scores, never pick the highest number unless the rule was very
accurate and the highest number was for the most recent data).

That's very perceptive of you.  Many people are not so willing to

great many popular con games exist by exploiting the perceptions of

Yahoo: The Case for Regime Change[1].



    

    Khatami asked the U.N. to set a deadline for Bush to step down in favor of 
    president-in-exile Al Gore the legitimate winner of the 2000 election, the 
    results of which were subverted through widespread voting irregularities 
    and intimidation.  

    [... This will likely require] a prolonged bombing campaign targeting major 
    U.S. cities and military installations, followed by a ground invasion led 
    by European forces. ""Civilian casualties would likely be substantial,"" said 
    a French military analyst. ""But the American people must be liberated from 
    tyranny."" 

    [...] ""Even before Bush, the American political system was a shambles,"" 
    said Prof. Salvatore Deluna of the University of Madrid. ""Their 
    single-party plutocracy will have to be reshaped into true 
    parliamentary-style democracy. Moreover, the economy will have to be 
    retooled from its current military dictatorship model--in which a third of 
    the federal budget goes to arms, and taxes are paid almost exclusively by 
    the working class--to one in which basic human needs such as education and 
    poverty are addressed. Their infrastructure is a mess; they don't even have 
    a national passenger train system. Fixing a failed state of this size will 
    require many years.""

Jakob Nielsen on Offshore Usability[1]: ""To save costs, some companies are 
outsourcing Web projects to countries with cheap labor. Unfortunately, these 
countries lack strong usability traditions and their developers have limited 
access -- if any -- to good usability data from the target users."" 

Offshore usability is a specific case of the general ""offshore design"" problem. 
Put simply, software teams are not successful when 
design or management are done in a different physical location than 
programming. Once I actually had a job where I was in New York, my direct 
manager was in Singapore, _his_ manager was in Hyderabad, and if I needed 
any management input I had literally no choice but to go to the CEO because at 
least he was awake during the same hours as I was. You can't get things done 
like this. A good project team relies on hundreds of small interactions a day. 
Here in the Fog Creek offices, we have 10 small conversations about FogBUGZ 3.0 
development every day. 

What I don't understand is people who think it's OK to move the developers ten 
time zones away from their managers and expect good results. Those same people 
would scream bloody murder if you told them that you were going to 
send the whole _management_ team to Bangalore or Beijing.

I've done a dist-upgrade from 7.2 to a quite broken rawhide release... it
was a mess, still, it went much faster and smoother than if I had done it
""manually"" with rpm -U or -F. I think that updates between stable releases
should still be done with the installer since IIRC, sometimes a few
twitches are done by anaconda to migrate configurations to new formats. It
should work though... I still prefer backuping config files and
reinstalling a clean system when I have the time.

With project budgets in the multiple millions of dollars and virtually no 
margin for error, more and more development teams are under tremendous pressure 
to come out on top of the entertainment software market's cutthroat 
competition. No team manager wants to contemplate dropping the ball when 
creating the vivid graphics necessary to help make a game a success. Electronic 
Arts' The Sims franchise is an excellent example of this pressurized situation. 
This article highlights the critical issues that govern the high volume asset 
production needed for today's most demanding games.

This wouldn't be worth the effort involved IMHO, and would probably end up
in relative breakage of a few systems if not carefully tested.
Your first example is a good one, because I really think it's even easier
currently :
1. Leave your current kernel as-is
2. Get the ""alsa-driver"" source rpm
3. Rebuild and install resulting packages

Drivers that are written to be easily compiled as modules (like ltmodem,
NVidia, ALSA etc.) can easily be repackaged separately as rpms and ported
as easily for various kernel rpms from the source rpm.

Also, what you describe is sort of the opposite of what rpm packaging is in
my mind. I see it more as a ""one size fits all"" achievement in the general
case. And kernel isn't an exception (although there are packages optimized
for various processors) since they all come with just about all the modules
you'll ever need. Make that ""one size fits many"" then if you want ;-)

Last but not least : The kernel is something I'm trying to keep away from
in my packaging since I really don't want to see newbies screwing up their
systems because of packages on my website... same goes for GNOME, KDE and
other major bits of the distribution since I also want people who happily
use my packages to be able to upgrade to the next Red Hat Linux release
without having their system turned into another Ximian mess.

raise of evolvable formats,"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/08.html#in_praise_of_evolvable_formats
Date: 2002-10-08T12:28:10-05:00

_Clay Shirky_: In Praise of Evolvable Systems[1]. This entire article could be 
rewritten to explain RSS. In fact, let's do that. 

If it were April Fool's Day, the Net's only official holiday, and you wanted to 
design a &#8220;novelty format&#8221; to slip by the W3C as a joke, it might 
look something like RSS 0.9x/2.0: 

- It would specify limits on data values, then remove them, then specify 
required elements, then make them optional, thus silently breaking an unknown 
number of parsers around the world. 
- It would encourage use of entity-encoded HTML in its most important element, 
thus ensuring both security risks and unpredictable display for the end user. 
- It would ignore years of standards work in other fields, committing such 
egregious sins as defining a guid element that wasn't a GUID, and using an 
obsolete date format that couldn't easily be sorted by date. 
- Its primary method of extensibility would be to add new elements to the core 
namespace without telling anyone or documenting them, thus making it wholely 
resistant to DTD, schema, or validation of any kind. 
- After years of worldwide deployment, it would completely reverse its 
add-whatever-you-want extensibility rules in favor of namespaces, which the 
spec would neither define nor elaborate on. 
- After adopting namespaces, it would fail to deprecate any existing elements 
semantically identical to namespace elements already in wide use. It would also 
fail to provide precedence rules in cases where a document attempted to say the 
same thing in two different ways, thus ensuring mass confusion among producers 
and inconsistent behavior across consumers. 

RSS 0.9x and 2.0 are the Whoopee Cushion and Joy Buzzer of syndication formats. 
For anyone who has tried to accomplish anything serious with metadata, it's 
pretty obvious that of the various implementations of a worldwide syndication 
format, we have the worst one possible. 

Except, of course, for all the others. 

The problem with that list of RSS deficiencies is that it is also a list of 
necessities&#8212;RSS has flourished in a way that no other syndication format 
has, not despite many of these qualities but because of them. The very 
weaknesses that make RSS so infuriating to serious practitioners also make it 
possible in the first place. 

- Removing length limitations on description and making title optional opened 
up RSS to a whole new category of producer: the weblogger. 
- Allowing encoded HTML in description let publishers reuse both their existing 
content and the existing RSS infrastructure, without requiring them to produce 
valid XHTML (which could be embedded directly into an XML document). Social 
mores, rather than technical rules, prevent producers from intentionally 
introducing security risks through malicious script tags or unpredictable 
display through unclosed HTML elements. 
- Few publishing tools can produce real conforming GUIDs, and it doesn't 
matter, because virtually all RSS parsers are written in high level languages 
where handling strings is more efficient than converting strings to bytecodes 
and handling bytecodes. As for dates, by convention an RSS document is laid out 
in reverse chronological order, and no one seems to be clamoring for more 
flexibility. 

Furthermore, its almost babyish XML syntax, so far from any serious 
computational framework (Where are the namespaces? Where is the Document Type 
Description? Why is the aggregators' enforcement of conformity so lax?), made 
it possible for anyone wanting an RSS feed to write one. The effects of this 
ease of implementation only become clear when you compare it to the attempts 
over the years to &#8220;do RSS right&#8221;&#8212;most notably RSS 1.0 in the 
year 2000. RSS 1.0 had three main benefits: 

- Backward compatible with RSS 0.90, which was never widely deployed, and which 
fell into obscurity as soon as (the much simpler) RSS 0.91 was introduced. 
- Based on RDF (specifically a serialization called RDF/XML), a spec which, at 
the time and to this day, continues to change or threaten to change. Two years 
later, there are no major languages or development platforms that ship with 
parsers to consume RDF, although many (Perl, Python, .NET) have third-party RDF 
parsers in various states of development and conformance. (The release version 
is generally out of date; CVS access is recommended. You get the idea.) 
Meanwhile, RDF/XML production tools are so inconsistent that even RDF experts 
recommend not using RDF tools to produce an RSS 1.0 feed if you want it to 
actually be read by any major RSS aggregator. Despite the two-year-old promise 
of better tools[2], it is now the year 2002, and I built my RSS 1.0 
feed&#8212;in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the 
world&#8212;by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets 
into a TEXTAREA of an HTML form. 
- Extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been 
haphazardly and poorly incorporated into RSS 2.0, where they appear to be 
flourishing. 

Evolvable formats&#8212;those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a 
thousand small ways&#8212;have three main characteristics that are germane to 
their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats. 

- Only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. 
My RSS feed is an XML document produced by a template that I built in a 
TEXTAREA, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know 
nothing of XML and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. The world is 
littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. 
If everyone in the world had a perfect RDF parser at their disposal, it would 
be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in RDF. Without such 
perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. 
There is no middle ground. 
- What is, is wrong. Because evolvable formats have always been adapted to 
earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, 
they are always behind the times. RSS was being stretched with long 
descriptions, optional titles, and entity-encoded HTML even before such 
practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle 
them. No evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it 
faces. 
- Finally, Orgel's Rule, named for the evolutionary biologist Leslie 
Orgel&#8212;&#8220;Evolution is cleverer than you are&#8221;. As with the list 
of RSS's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with 
any evolvable system at any point in its life. No one seeing RSS 1.0 and RSS 
0.91 side-by-side could doubt that RSS 1.0 had the superior technology, that it 
&#8220;did things right&#8221;. However, the ability to understand what is 
missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central 
group can design a better system in the long haul. 

Designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. Evolvable 
formats start out weak and improve exponentially. RSS 2.0 is not the perfect 
syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. 
Infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, 
partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition.

For consultancy, integration or open source work, sure, perl, python or
java with free use of external libs makes a lot of sense IMO.

I should note that normally when I've used C or C++ in the past, it's
dictated by the fact that I would be working on a commercial product,
written from the ground up, where the code you're generating is important
IP for the company; in this case, using a third-party lib often is not an
option, or would be a PITA licensing-wise.

Also, cutting out third-party dependencies can reduce the risk of ""oops,
there goes the company that makes that library I depend on, now to shop
around for something vaguely similar, figure out what bugs it's got,
rewrite my code to use the new API, and hope for the best"".

This can be a *very* big deal, for obvious reasons ;)    Open source
knockers should note that this is not a problem when using LGPL'd libs ;)

chist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire (fwd),"
[Destined to be a new reality TV Show?]


Anarchist 'Scavenger Hunt' Raises D.C. Police Ire
Sat Sep 21, 3:37 PM ET

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An online ""anarchist scavenger
hunt"" proposed for next week's annual meeting of the
International Monetary Fund ( news - web sites) and
World Bank ( news - web sites) here has raised the ire
of police, who fear demonstrators could damage
property and wreak havoc.

Break a McDonald's window, get 300 points. Puncture a
Washington D.C. police car tire to win 75 points.
Score 400 points for a pie in the face of a corporate
executive or World Bank delegate.

D.C. Assistant Police Chief Terrance Gainer told a
congressional hearing on Friday that law authorities
were in talks to decide whether planned protests were,
""so deleterious to security efforts that we ought to
take proactive action.""

Several thousand people are expected to demonstrate
outside the IMF and World Bank headquarters next
weekend.

The Anti-Capitalist Convergence, a D.C.-based
anarchist group, is also planning a day-long traffic
blockade, banner-drops and protests against major
corporations in the downtown core.

Chuck, the 37 year-old webmaster of the anarchist site
www.infoshop.org who declined to give his last name,
told Reuters his scavenger hunt was meant as a joke.

""People were asking for things to do when they come to
D.C. We made the list to get people thinking, so they
don't do the boring, standard stuff,"" he said. ""I
doubt people will actually keep track of what they do
for points.""

A terrible argument. There are better technical solutions to privacy
protection than sending a copy of the same message to everyone on the
Internet, so the recipients can't be blamed for reading it.

Folks, 

Some of you seem to have hardcoded honor as the default catalogue
server. There are three catalogue only servers running now, and honor is
acting as a nomination only server. Tonight we will be completely
turning off catalogue support on honor, so if you are specifying honor
with the -rs option, please take it out and let the agents discover a
closeby catalogue server.

cheers,

Actually, 5.6. I clocked my &#8220;long loop&#8221; today and discovered that 
the run I thought was 6 miles is actually only 5.6. And the &#8220;short 
loop&#8221; I thought was 5 miles is actually only 4.6. I have an off-by-0.4 
bug. This is very upsetting. I've lost 0.4 miles somewhere. If anyone finds 
them, can you please let me know? Thank you. 

I ran 9 miles last week, and 10 so far this week, even taking into account my 
off-by-0.4 bug. I fear I am turning into a runner. My father and I made fun of 
runners when I was growing up. He used to say that you never saw a runner 
smiling. We'd drive by runners, point at them, and say, &#8220;Look, another 
runner... not smiling!&#8221; This weighed heavily on my psyche in my formative 
years. So it is with some measure of shame that I admit that I am becoming a 
runner. 

Becoming a runner is actually not that difficult. Not surprisingly, it involves 
running. There's other stuff, too, eventually, but running is the important 
part. If you can run a mile, run a mile. If you can only run around the block, 
run around the block. Tomorrow you'll run around the block, and the next day 
you'll find you can run around two blocks. And next week you'll find you can 
run a mile. Then one day you'll run a mile, then stop to catch your breath, 
then get invigorated and run another mile. 

And then you're a runner. That's it, really. It's not complicated. You run, and 
you run, and you run. And one day, you discover that shoes are important, and 
that the old sneakers you threw on the first time you tried out this running 
thing out aren't actually very good for running. So you go buy new shoes, and 
you run, and you run, and you run. And later, you discover that stretching is 
important too, so you stretch and run, and stretch and run, and stretch and 
run. 

There's other stuff too, but it doesn't really matter until you're already a 
runner. You learn about differences in running surfaces. And how many miles you 
should really put on one pair of shoes. And when in the day you should run to 
maximize calorie burning. And how to train for a marathon, and so forth. Don't 
worry about any of that now. Just run. Running is key. Otherwise you're just 
another fat schmuck lying on the couch reading _Runner's World_.

Yes, them too.  When wolves attack their sheep, they coral the wolf

that ""no one will know who killed the wolf""

It's not just krpm, the desktop HDs have a higher failure rate. But I
agree, EIDE has high density, and EIDE hardware RAID can offer SCSI a
sound beating for reliability, performance, and storage density/rack units

There are not all that many hard drives inside an 1U enclosure. Airflow
blockage (you have to fit in 2-3x the number of SCSI disks with EIDE) will
soon be a thing of the past due to SATA.

Since rack-space costs dominate, and our systems need more or less decent
I/O we're going with 1U Dells with SCSI. The hard drive prices don't
really make a visible difference, given the cost of the iron, and the
rackspace/month. Plus, 1U Dells don't have any space left for lots of EIDE
drives.

Stunned: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer,"Glad they finally figured this one out... Note the very careful wording, so

EPA: Diesel Exhaust Can Cause Cancer
Wed Sep 4, 3:29 AM ET
By H. JOSEF HEBERT, Associated Press Writer

WASHINGTON (AP) - Inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other
sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an Environmental Protection
Agency ( news - web sites) report concludes after a decade of study.

The EPA finding, released Tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's
push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleaner-burning engines
and diesel fuel with ultra-low sulfur content.

While acknowledging uncertainties about the long-term health effects of
exposure to diesel exhausts, the EPA report said studies involving both
animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer
risk to humans.

""It is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental
exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""The potential human health
effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and
uncertainties are involved.""

The report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various
world health agencies and studies in California and is particularly
significant because the EPA is the federal agency that regulates diesel
emissions under the Clean Air Act.

Some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the Bush
administration might try to back away from a Clinton-era regulation that
would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a
separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel.

EPA Administrator Christie Whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with
the tougher truck and diesel rules. Last month, with White House approval,
the EPA rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone
the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to
meet an October deadline for making cleaner-burning truck engines.

The engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road,
although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel
is expected to produce pollution reductions.

The EPA's 651-page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the
probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to
diesel exhaust. Such a risk assessment is commonly made by the EPA when
gauging pollution health concerns.

But in this case, the report said, ""the exposure-response data are
considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of
cancer risk to an individual.

Nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal
and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be
carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to
environmental exposure.""

The report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses
short-term health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a
""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and
other respiratory problems. In some urban areas diesel exhausts account for
as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said.

Environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs
to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from off-road
diesel-powered vehicles. EPA spokeswoman Steffanie Bell said the agency
expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust
sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment.

Emily Figdor of the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, a private
environmental organization, said: ""To reduce the public's exposure to
harmful diesel emissions, the Bush administration should ... fully implement
clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent
standards for diesel construction and farm equipment.""

Allen Schaeffer, executive director of the industry group Diesel Technology
Forum, said the EPA's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is
clean diesel. Diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times
cleaner than just a dozen years ago.""

The report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in
the mid-1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow
turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.

Terminal velocity can be calculated by $v_{T} = \sqrt{\frac{2mg}{CpA}}$
where C is an experimentally determined coefficient, p is the density of the
air, and A is the area of the object. These calculations only work if the
object is blunt and the airflow is turbulent, blah blah blah. Terminal velocity
for a skydiver actually varies with how the diver holds themselves -- you go
faster if you pull yourself into a cannonball. That is the ""A"", for the
most part. 

All else being equal, the terminal velocity is inversely proportional to the
square root of air density. Air density drops off pretty quickly, and I 
really should be doing something other than digging up the math for that. I
think it involves calculus to integrate the amount of mass as the column of
the atmosphere trails off. I grabbed the other stuff directly out of a book :).

In '87 a guy named Gregory Robertson noticed a fellow parachutist Debbie 
Williams had been knocked unconscious. He shifted so that he was head down,
hit about 200 mi/h, and caught up with her and pulled her chute with 10 seconds

Many spammers make money not from response to the spam, but from selling
the service of spamming on behalf of someone else.  You might track down
whoever paid for the mailing, but tracking down the actual sender might be
more difficult, and even if they manage to recover damages from the buyer
they haven't stopped the spammer, so the benefit is strictly to Habeas,
not to the recipients of the spam.  That's the main problem I have with
the whole scenario: My pain, Habeas's gain, and those most likely to be
held liable are those least likely to be the really serious abusers.

The right to speak is not the same as the right to be heard by the audience
of the speakers choice.

Disruptive protests might be a means to create awareness - but that's a
pretty lame way to do it. If it truly is the only way, then I'm all for it,
but disruption for the sake of showing how committed the protesters are is
pretty weak.

My tests train on about 7,000 msgs, and a binary pickle of the database is
approaching 10 million bytes.  I haven't done anything to try to reduce its
size, and know of some specific problem areas (for example, doing character
5-grams of ""long words"" containing high-bit characters generates a lot of
database entries, and I suspect they're approximately worthless).  OTOH,
adding in more headers will increase the size.  So let's call it 10 meg
<wink>.

Heh. I hit the same problem, but the other way round, when I first
started playing with this - I'd collected spam for a week or two, 
then mixed it up with randomly selected messages from my mail boxes.

course, it instantly picked up on 'received:2001' as a non-ham. 

Curse that too-smart-for-me software. Still, it's probably a good
thing to note in the documentation about the software - when collecting
spam/ham, make _sure_ you try and collect from the same source.

Do you have a dialup or something more modern <wink>?  134MB of messages
zipped would probably compress pretty well - under 50MB I'd guess with all
the similarity in the headers and such.  You could zip each of the 10 sets

How about random sampling lots of public mailing lists via gmane or
something similar, manually cleaning it (distributing that load over a
number of people) and then relying on your clever code and your rebalancing
script to help further cleanse it?  The ""problem"" with the ham is it tends
to be much more tied to one person (not just intimate, but unique) than the
spam.

I save all incoming email for ten days (gzipped mbox format) before it rolls
over and disappears.  At any one time I think I have about 8,000-10,000
messages.  Most of it isn't terribly personal (which I would cull before
passing along anyway) and much of it is machine-generated, so would be of
marginal use.  Finally, it's all ham-n-spam mixed together.  Do we call that
an omelette or a Denny's Grand Slam?

Storing passwords,"If you need to store a database password, then
clearly the first step is to store the text outside the
web tree.  You can encrypt it and store the encryption key elsewhere,
so that at least an attacker has to get two different things.
Also, don't get full privileges - create a user account that
is GRANTed very limited access.

However, you can often do better than this if security
is critical.  Create a separate program which has these
database keys (as noted above), and make the web program
contact IT.  Create a very limited protocol that ONLY
lets you do the operations you need (you can add specific
operations later).  There's a performance hit, which you're
trading for improved data isolation.

Ah, sorry for not making that clearer.
But no.
Previously (v1.0.6 of GnuPG) there would be a slight pause at this point while
it went out to get the public key from a keyserver.
Now, whether I have the key or NOT, I get the failure message.

Its as if it cant find gpg to execute it (but I fixed that path), so there
must be something else that I am missing...

Don't worry about the warnings. To fix the error, edit spamc.c and right 
after the line that says:

#define EX__MAX 77

Add:

#if !defined __osf__
extern char *optarg;
typedef unsigned long   in_addr_t;      /* base type for internet address */
#endif

(you're adding the two lines that start with #).

I did so.  Alas, stripping HTML tags from all text still hurts the f-n rate

Last time I tried this (see tokenizer.py comments), the f-n rate after
stripping tags ranged from 0.982% to 1.781%, with a median of about 1.34%,
so we've made tons of progress on the f-n rate since then.  But the mere
presence of HTML tags still remains a significant clue for c.l.py traffic,
so I'm left with the same comment:

> # XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
> # XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.

If we want to take the focus of this away from c.l.py traffic, I can't say
what effect HTML stripping would have (I don't have suitable test data to
measure that on).

Yes it does. And if you're missing the dependencies needed for the selected
options, you'll even be informed! (for ALSA, you'll need alsa-lib-devel for
example)

Yup... unfortunately the alsa-kernel needs to be rebuilt for each kernel,
and there's no way of avoiding it.

It could be an online system that work 95% offline but poll frequently an 
offsite server.  No mass production CDs, maybe mass personalised d/l like Sun 
JDK.

Nothing is fixed yet, we are looking at the way a software can be protected 
from unauthorized utilisation.  

Is the use of ""trusted hardware"" really worth it ?  Does it really make it 
more secure ?  Look at the DVDs.

That is, if you concede that of the two founding branches, only the

You'd have to explain ""found in the wild"".  For example, I know of

When we launched the Native Net in 1989, one of the first things we
noticed on networking aboriginal groups around the world is that the
British Army, with the US Army as a proxy by extension, were the
common thread.  Where neither was present (physically or through
influence) there /tended/ to be less violence.

The issue in Ireland is complex, but rest assured that religious
aspects are only a co-incidence of the invader/colonials being
predominantly members of the Royal-headed Anglicans and the aboriginal
population being predominantly members of the Pope-headed Catholics.
The conflict itself has nothing to do with ideology or practice, since
the Anglican Church is a near-identical clone of Catholicism.

(now I bet that's going to attract some healthy debate ;)

    S> .. most Protestants are unionists who want the
    S> province to remain part of Britain.

Mebst. Mebst.  It's the other way around.  Most Unionists are protestants.
It's their _Unionism_ that is the source of the conflict, not their
sacriments.

    S> ... Police records and historians agree that the most lethal

And which side of the colonial fence do you suppose the Police and
Historians sit?  If the Russians had invaded the USA as feared in
episodes such as the Bay of Pigs, would the Americans have organized
to become a ""lethal force"", or would they have just said, ""Oh well,
there goes /that/ democracy!"" and settle in under communist rule?

Just wondering.

    >> 2. The US is trying to avoid making war on the Muslim religion.

It is interesting to me that the Canadian media is trying to paint
Chretien as some sort of buffoon for saying that 3rd-world poverty was
a major contributor to 9-11.  If they'd /watch/ his now-infamous
interview, they'd see that it's still us-against-hooligans, but his
point is that the hooligans would not be able to find friendly states
so easily if those states were not so bled-dry by the west.

The same is true of street-gangs: When people are disenfranchised,
it's easier to offer them the Triad as a new family.  You get
cellphones, cars, a dry place to live.  Triad, biker gangs, mafia, the
IRA, Al Queda ... we've been fighting the War on Terrorism for as long
as there's been commerce, so you'd think we'd /realize/ that
escalation of violence is not a solution.

There was a fascinating article in the Economist 1-2 weeks back (the issue
with a pregnant-looking Statue of Liberty on the Front) that stated that
even for the native US population, fertility had jumped in the last decade
and a half. I think the current figure for the US is a little over 2, but
not quite the ~2.1 of replacement rate. Combined with the very fertile
non-native population, the article implied the US was going to have a
significant increase in population over earlier predictions. As well, the
population would overall be more youthful, with associated implications for
being able to fund social programs, military spending, consumer spending,
etc.

Europe did not show the same increase in fertility.

Some actual data for the US are here:

You choose to have your email client do that.  You don't have to.  Short
of Palladium, you can do whatever you want with bytes you hold, including
reading messages and erasing the traces.  I'll buy a chocolate sundae for
anyone who can show otherwise.

An attacker might be able to verify that you *have* read a message (e.g.  
by seeing that you saved and edited a copy) but not that you *haven't*.  
If your email client was compromised you could put a packet sniffer on the
line before downloading mail.  If an attacker installed a packet sniffer
sniffer, you could run it in a spoofing VM.

The only exception to the rule that your machine belongs to you is --
maybe -- Palladium.

Right.  Because Americans are the only people capable of being

We've decided to go with XFS (which Linus has just merged into the 2.5

deletions (we use these systems for caching our 2 petabyte tape store). 
  Ext3 almost did it but dropped from from ~38MB/s to 10 with random

Oddly, even fairly beefy systems like these will breathe hard to keep up

Electric car an Edsel...,"Sunday I drove from Portland down to the Woodburn Dragstrip to check out 
the NEDRA Nationals. <http://www.nedra.com/>

The electric cars, motorcycles and dragsters had some great times and I 
ended up with a few pics and a nice deep burn...

John Waylan (who was interviewed in Wired a few years back) pulled out a 
14.4 second run in the quarter mile (91mph), on a battery pack that 
hasn't been broken in yet. He expects to break his record next year 
topping his 13.1sec/99mph run a couple of years ago. He's shooting for a 
12 second run.

John also took out a replica 1908 Oldsmobile for a respectable 47mph 
run. (Remember, we started out with electric cars.)

Near the end of the day, Kilacycle took the track with an amazing 111mph 
run. Talk about a crotch rocket.

   Thanks for posting this tip - I had the same problem compiling with
Tru64 and that took care of it.

   When I did the ""make install"" I got this error:

LOCK:  -f /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
 || cp rules/local.cf /etc/mail/spamassassin/local.cf
sh: syntax error at line 1: `||' unexpected
*** Exit 2
Stop.

   It appears that this comes from the ""inst_cfs:"" part of the Makefile,
which copies local.cf into /etc/mail/spamassassin.  The Makefile has
brackets around the -f test, but they don't show up above.  Any ideas?

Great piece on the pulp comic characters that appear in the new series of Alan

These characters, like The Terror and The Fighting Yank, are in the public 
domain because their original publishers didn't register (or renew, it's 
unclear) their copyright, which means that they've been granted a new lease on 
life in _Tom Strong_. The article segues into a very good discussion of the

You are not still using sourceforge, are you? If you have any hopes that they 
are anything but yet another business giving away a free service, then see

mbayes] [ANN] Trained classifier available,"    http://sf.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=61702

    This is the binary pickle of my classifier after training on
    my first spam/ham corpora pair.  All records with
    spamprob == UNKNOWN_SPAMPROB have been purged.

It's in a zip file, and is only half a meg.

Jeremy, it would be interesting if you tried that on your data.  The false
negative rates across my other 4 test sets when run against this are:

      0.364%
      0.400%

It doesn't work that way.  A website is opt-in, spam is no-opt.  If you
visit a samizdat site you can get in trouble.  If you get samizdat spam,
the worst that can be said is that you might have read it.  And as long as
the mailers send to individuals who clearly didn't opt-in, like party
officials, then other recipients can't get in trouble for requesting the
mail.  

Plus, it's much harder to block spam than web sites.

But this shouldn't come as a surprize.  Spam is speech.  It may be sleazy, 
but so what.

ev] [Bug 1053] New: IMG tag based rules,"http://www.hughes-family.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=1053

           Summary: IMG tag based rules
           Product: Spamassassin
           Version: unspecified
          Platform: Other
        OS/Version: other
            Status: NEW
          Severity: enhancement
          Priority: P2
         Component: Eval Tests
        AssignedTo: spamassassin-devel@example.sourceforge.net
        ReportedBy: matt@nightrealms.com


Inspired by complaints about all-image or mostly-image spam that's
getting by SA, I've cooked up three sets of rules that analyze the use
of IMG tags in HTML: one that looks at the total area of all of the
images in the message (T_HTML_IMAGE_AREA*), one that looks at the
total number of images in the message (T_HTML_NUM_IMGS*), and one that
looks at the longest total run of consecutive images
(T_HTML_CONSEC_IMG*).

===============

The total area of all images is rather easy to compute: inside of
HTML::html_tests(), if an IMG tag has both the width and height
properties, then multiply them together and add the result to the
running total.

Spam % of all rules with S/O > 0.90: 31.25%

=========================

I figured that spam that is made up of only images is going to only
have IMG tags interspersed with table, paragraph and linebreak tags,
and some whitespace, so there would be a lot of IMG tags with no plain
text (non-whitespace) between them.  So I defined consecutive IMG tags
to be ones with no text between them, and looked at the longest run of
consecutive IMGs within a message.

This one seems to do pretty good, because in my non-spam corpus
there's only a handful of messages with IMG runs larger than two.

==========================

Next I'm going to see if there's any meta rules I can make that will
reduce the FP rate for low S/O rules.

By starting up your own companies or working in sterile thinklabs you are
cutting yourself off from one heck of a fertile ground for linkages....the

I like the shurch idea as well. Other ideas...

about EFF issues. Jon Lebkowsky was there -- hell, he organized it -- and he 
blogged the hell out of the talk: 

    Entertainment industry has tradition of attacking technology: the piano 
    roll, the radio (sued by vaudeville), television (would destroy cinema!), 
    ""the Betamax affair""... the latter being the first consumer VCR. In Betamax 
    case, argued that the ability to make a full copy of a broadcast work would 
    not be a fair use (in terms of copyright). It was illegal enough that the 
    VCR should be kept off the market, they argued. The Supreme Court got the 
    case, and the thing that shook out of it was the Betamax principle: a 
    technology is legal so long as it has substantial non-infringeing uses. 
    This principle is under attack. 

    Digital Millennium Copyright Act, 1998. Illegal to defeat a copyright 
    measure. Regionalization system for DVDs. This is a control that limits 
    distribution. John Johansen in Norway figured out how to break the content 
    scrambling system and allows you to move from one region to another, 
    override copy protection. It was called DeCSS - Johansen is facing trial 
    for creating a piece of code.

Shouldn't that read

(And, JIC something else changed the context in the background, it 
 doesn't hurt to explicitly state the folder:

the f-p rate wouldn't have changed at all if the spamprob cutoff were

It doesn't need to as Red Hat Linux already sets correct permissions on all
ALSA audio devices for locally logged in users (through the console.perms
file) and the modules.conf files takes care of loading the right modules on
demand. Also, aumix and the scripts that come with Red Hat Linux still work
for controlling the volume, so it's still saved and restored when the
computer is halted, even using ALSA.

I'm glad you got your card working with these! I'm now wondering if I won't
maybe buy an amplifier that supports Dolby Digial decoding (my current one
""only"" does PRo Logic) since I've read that ALSA supports the S/PDIF
optical output of the sound chip of my Shuttle!

since having a full OSS compatibility results that it breaks nothing at

ALB> Selling Wedded Bliss Big Business in Thailand
ALB> Thu Aug 29,10:19 AM ET
ALB> By Andrew Marshall

ALB> BANGKOK, Thailand (Reuters) - English dentist Ken Moylan came to Thailand
ALB> looking for a wife. It took two hours to find her.

ALB> ""The first day I went out with Wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all
ALB> my clothes up and tidied the room. I thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""I
ALB> knew then there was something special.""

ALB> Moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet
ALB> -- and marry -- Thai women. He lives in England now with 28-year-old Wan,
ALB> who is expecting their first child.

ALB> Critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women
ALB> in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the West that
ALB> often turn sour. But Moylan says he has no regrets about coming to Thailand
ALB> in search of a wife.

ALB> ""I got to Thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. I'd met Wan,"" he said. ""I knew I
ALB> found her attractive. I could tell straight away that she was very caring.""

ALB> Moylan spent a week in Thailand, and after returning to England kept in
ALB> touch with Wan by phone and mail. Six months later she came to England and
ALB> the couple married.

ALB> MR. MARRIAGE

ALB> Lawrence Lynch, 49, runs Thai Professional Introduction Services, the agency
ALB> Moylan used to meet his wife. Lynch, who calls himself ""Mr. Marriage,""
ALB> started the company after also marrying a Thai woman through an introduction
ALB> agency.

ALB> Since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages.

ALB> ""In the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""To the best of my
ALB> knowledge, they have all been successful.""

ALB> Male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that
ALB> require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount.
ALB> Clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of Thai women
ALB> looking for a husband. If they like what they see they come to Bangkok.

ALB> Clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in Lynch's
ALB> office -- encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and
ALB> language problems.

ALB> ""We find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,""
ALB> Lynch said. ""But once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax.""

ALB> After the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know
ALB> each other better. Within two weeks of arrival, Lynch says, almost every
ALB> client has found a potential wife.

ALB> ""At the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and
ALB> think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. In most cases, marriage follows,
ALB> usually within the next year.

ALB> Roongthip Kamchat, managing director of Thai No. 1 Connections, a
ALB> Bangkok-based agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less
ALB> than 10 percent have broken up.

ALB> Roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just
ALB> arrived in Bangkok looking for a wife.

ALB> ""Sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""And sometimes they are very
ALB> impatient and say 'Give me a lady, I want to get married now.' I say: 'Calm
ALB> down, OK, we'll talk.""'

ALB> But if men are really in a hurry, Roongthip says, she can find them a wife
ALB> and get them married within a week. Lynch says clients he has found wives
ALB> for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with post-traumatic
ALB> stress disorder.

ALB> WHY?

ALB> Similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. Critics
ALB> say they thrive on the neediness of lonely Western men who are unable to
ALB> form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of
ALB> impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the West.

ALB> But Moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is
ALB> no reason to object. ""If you talk about people who are needy, I think
ALB> everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, I
ALB> need Wan,"" he said.

ALB> ""Thai women are dissatisfied with life in Thailand. I think there's no
ALB> secret there. They are looking for a better life. I don't have a problem
ALB> with that. In return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to
ALB> their future husband.""

ALB> Lynch says men are dissatisfied with Western women too, and that is why they
ALB> choose to use his agency.

ALB> His brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of de-feminized,
ALB> over-sized, self-centered, mercenary-minded lady available on the British
ALB> singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are
ALB> not ""God's gift to women.""

ALB> Roongthip said many Western men found it difficult to meet women in their
ALB> own countries -- and found Thai women attractive.

ALB> ""They don't know how to meet women. Even if they go to pubs or discotheques
ALB> or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them?
ALB> Impossible,"" she said.

ALB> ""Many Thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. They are
ALB> good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. Different from
ALB> ladies from other countries.""

ALB> Although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap,
ALB> the agencies say this is not a problem. They say language problems are also
ALB> not a major obstacle.

ALB> ""Thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having
ALB> a husband who is significantly older,"" Lynch said. ""When I met my wife she
ALB> couldn't speak a word of English. We muddled along with a phonetic
ALB> dictionary. The ladies are very keen to learn English and they pick it up
ALB> very quickly.""

ALB> Many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move
ALB> to the West.

ALB> ""We have kitchens, we have study classes,"" Roongthip said. ""We teach them
ALB> how to eat, and when to make tea.""

ALB> PITFALLS

ALB> But not all dreams come true. ""Bee"" is a 26-year-old Thai woman who went to
ALB> Switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. Now she is
ALB> back in Bangkok, sad and angry.

ALB> ""He had no friends, and I was so lonely,"" she said. ""I tried to make him
ALB> happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. He never
ALB> spoke to me.""

ALB> Bee came back to Bangkok earlier this year. ""I thought I would be happy
ALB> there,"" she said. ""But it was the worst time of my life.""

ALB> Lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure
ALB> unsuitable candidates are weeded out.

ALB> ""We are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""We will not take on all
ALB> comers.""

ALB> Moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the
ALB> arrangement can work. Wan's sister has just signed up with Lynch's company,
ALB> looking for a foreign husband.

ALB> ""Perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. I'm sure there are,""
ALB> Moylan said. ""But in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""

ps: I have the sequences window vertical instead of horizontal, and the

good as the old unseen window used to look.   I still have some work to
do to make it a little nicer (listboxes seem to have some strange habits)
and then I need to make it all optional and parameterized, at the minute
I'm just embedding stuff in the code, much quicker for prototyping.  Once
its done, I'll send a patch for someone to look over.

No, that would be rather silly. There are conflicting reports on whether
Zambia is prepared to accept milled GM grain or not - and, from reports from
various sources, considerable debate within that country. There's complex
issues, not all of which can be dismissed by blaming those nasty
environmentalists, which was my original point.

The idea came at the end of a long, frustrating brown-bag session at a
public-policy think tank here.

The challenge was to save the city's child-care programs. Staring into
his empty coffee cup, the meeting coordinator's mind landed on an
unlikely solution: Put a tax--just a ""benign"" dime a shot--on
espresso.

That led to a petition signed by more than 20,000 Seattle residents,
and next year, voters will decide whether the tax becomes law, one
that taps right into Seattle's legendary addiction to coffee. This is,
after all, the town where Starbucks was born and where the $12 pound
of beans became a staple. There is one Starbucks for every 7,000
residents in Seattle, compared to one per 64,000 in New York. Seattle
also has two other major coffee chains, Tully's Coffee and Seattle's
Best Coffee, as well as countless cafes and espresso carts.

A recent poll showed that 74% of Seattle residents would vote for the
tax. ""For people outside of Seattle who don't understand the
consumption of espresso, [the tax proposal] can be seen as crazy,""
said John Burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was
common sense.""

Research by his nonprofit Economic Opportunity Institute showed that
people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. But
because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on
espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol.

Burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a
year. City Council aides dispute his figures, saying their research
shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year.

Burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. The
think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of
low-income people, and it has long championed child-care issues.

Burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the child-care programs
made earlier this year by Gov. Gary Locke. He also says it would
provide more low-income families with subsidies for child care,
improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries.

At Bauhaus Books & Coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of
customers for whom coffee is a half-day activity, not just a drink.

Espresso lovers like Chris Altman, who at a dime a day would spend an
extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""I'm OK with
it,"" said the 35-year-old, stirring his iced latte. ""The money's got
to come from somewhere.""

Hope Revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she
brought her own mug) and reading ""Zen and the Art of Pottery."" She
supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be
expected of espresso drinkers: They want the most expensive thing on
the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy.

Some say the tax isn't the issue; they just resent being singled out.

David Marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a
day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""I, for
one, don't have kids, but I drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a
leather collar onto a chain-mail tunic. ""I don't mind paying, but I
think everyone should pay.""

Coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as
JOLT--Joined to Oppose the Latte Tax. Among the members are Seattle's
Chamber of Commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises,
Starbucks and Tully's.

The tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that
contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare
for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. If
espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a
city audit.

University of Chicago economics professor Michael Greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. 

""The purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is
neither,"" he said. ""On the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead
to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to
avoid the tax. For example, Starbucks could claim that they are using
finely ground coffee, [instead of coffee run though an espresso maker]
and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. Would they be
right? I don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal
fees that could have gone to child care.

""Of course, from a public-relations perspective, this is an ingenious
idea, and I mean that in a cynical way. They've pitted espresso
drinkers against child-care supporters, and who's going to side with
the espresso drinkers?""

In fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political
two-step, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public
stance of political correctness. In a liberal city like Seattle,
corporations continually advertise their commitment to social
activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, JOLT members
prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care.

""Starbucks will continue to support early-learning and
childhood-development programs through the millions of dollars we
contribute annually,"" the company said. ""However, Starbucks does not
understand why the Economic Opportunity Institute would recommend an
additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single
consumer product.""

The City Council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before
voters next year. The initiative's authors say it is directed at
vendors; critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through
higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee.
The tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of
espresso, including decaf. Drip coffee would be exempt.

Burbank says the tax would reach only a pre-selected group of
consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. So, he's been
pitching it as a modern-day Robin Hood tax, where the needy get a dime
every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso.

It's the kind of political marketing that Fran Beulah, 43, finds
funny. ""I drink espresso,"" she said, laughing, ""and I am not rich.""

[SAtalk] separate inbound and outbound,"
No I was just a little confused because I'm running procmail on a gateway
and sits between the external sendmail box and internal exchange bridgehead
server.  So there isn't any delivery to the local system.

The only email it gets is inbound at the moment and we're looking to get rid
of complication and go back to two boxes.  I did a test which looked like
you guys are right about procmail, but testing is very limited due to the
config I currently have.  It's just confusing when set up as a gateway.

Using procmail, SpamAssassin doesn't get called for outgoing email
(messages sent to other machines). 
Procmail=Local Delivery Agent => inbound traffic to LOCAL machine.

uple of nits...,"
I have a couple of small issues, and I'm not sure if their exmh issues
or my setup issues.

First, when I try and run exmh with wish from tk8.4.0 it seems to take
forever to start, but with wish from tk8.a.4 it starts in a snap.

Using the latest CVS, when I open exmh and the folder I'm in has unseen
messages and I hit next, exmh changes to the next folder with unseen messages
rather than to the first unseen in the current folder.

Finally, when I reach the end of the messages in a folder and go on to
the next unseen, exmh always goes back to inbox (which has no unseen
messages) rather than the next folder with unseen messages.  (When I 
goto next from inbox it does go where I would think it should go).

Just wanted to let you know what I'm seeing and find out if I'm expecting
some different than I should be.

Thanks for all the effort

Jim

There are a number of reasons to think that CO2 is not important to
controlling global temperature and that much of the CO2 increase may not
be anthropogenic. Some recent research points worth mentioning:

Recent high-resolution studies of historical CO2 concentrations and
temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest
correlation between the two. In a number of cases, CO2 level increases
are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the
increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature
preceded increases in CO2 concentrations. The more studies that are done
of the geological record, the more it seems that CO2 concentrations are
correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly
causative. There is a lot of evidence that CO2 levels are regulated in a
fairly stable fashion.  I don't believe anyone really has an
authoritative answer as to exactly how this works yet.

With respect to absolute CO2 concentrations, it is also important to
point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly
regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years.  At previous cycle
peaks, the concentrations were similar to what they are now.  If this
cycle has any validity (and we only have good data for 4-5 complete
cyclical periods, but which look surprisingly regular in shape and
time), then we should be almost exactly at a peak right now.  As it
happens, current CO2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous
cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. In other
words, we may be adding to the CO2 levels, but it looks a lot like we
would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical
record.  At the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current CO2
concentrations.

Also, CO2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately
affects temperature.  Again, the interaction is not entirely
predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative
feedback systems mentioned above.

Last, as greenhouse gases go, CO2 isn't particularly potent, although it
makes up for it in volume in some cases.  Gases such as water and
methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule
basis.  Water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something
that CO2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the
biosphere.

CO2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent
studies and data I've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a
passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver.  I certainly don't
think it is a healthy fixation if we're actually interested in
understanding warming trends.

G] The Age Old 'Which Mailer' Question,"I am trying to manage the email for a domain which I have hosted with

At the moment I have configured Fetchmail to poll the different pop3

to have only one unix user being able to receive from each pop3 mailbox.
This could be a limitation of the fetchmailconf programme, I'm not sure, but
It would be much handier if I could just tell it to collect all of the mail
from the different mailboxes, and then deliver it locally according to the
""To:"" header instead of the pop3 mailbox it came from.
The other issue I am having is sending outgoing mail.  I have been trying to
use sendmail, but am finding it to be an absolute pain in the posterior, and
when the relay server will only accept outgoing connections if I have
checked for incoming mail in the last twenty minutes, and I don't know how
to set sendmail to run a command before it sends out the mail.  Do any of
the outgoing mailer programs, exim or postfix or whatever, have a 'nice'
configuration interface, or do they all have nice friendly configuration
files like sendmail.

Any suggestions of alternative solutions would be much appreciated.  There
are only three or four email addresses in my domain, and setting it up for
scheduled collection and either scheduled or immediate delivery would do me
fine.

Internet can level the political playing field
By Mike McCurry and Larry Purpuro

NOT many months from now, people across the country will experience one 
of the great recurring features of American democracy. At shopping 
malls, on factory floors, at church socials and even on our front 
stoops, we will be approached by individuals who want to represent us in 
public office. While chances are high that we won't know them 
personally, they will walk up to us, offer a handshake and a flier and 
ask for our votes.

Just as technology is affecting every other area of communication, it 
has begun to affect the way political candidates communicate with voters.

In this year's GOP gubernatorial primary, California Secretary of State 
Bill Jones, who faced better-funded candidates, acquired the e-mail 
addresses of more than a million potential California voters and sent 
each an unsolicited e-mail asking for support.

That day, he might have chosen any of the more traditional -- and more 
expensive -- methods of contacting voters, such as direct mail, radio 
spots or TV ads. But he spent only about 2 cents per message, instead of 
35 cents or more per message for direct mail or in another medium.

Had Jones chosen direct mail, radio or TV, that communication would have 
been equally ``unsolicited,'' as defined in the e-mail world. Few voters 
would have ``opted in'' to receive campaign information from Jones 
through any of those channels.

The response to Jones' e-mail effort, however, was swift and intense. He 
was lambasted by anti-spam advocates, and media coverage was almost 
entirely negative. To be fair, some of Jones' tactics could have been 
refined. He used a less-than-perfect list and no standard-practice 
``paid for'' disclaimer in the message.

His detractors, however, attacked him not for his tactical miscues but 
because the e-mail was sent unsolicited. In fact, Jones' online campaign 
may have been his most visible asset. In an era of cynicism toward money 
in politics -- money typically spent on other unsolicited communication 
mediums -- Jones tried to level the playing field.

No one likes commercial spam. It is irrelevant and untargeted and can be 
highly intrusive and even offensive. But as a sophisticated society, 
it's time to differentiate commercial spam from very different 
unsolicited e-mail sent by political candidates to voters.

The debate is particularly relevant in light of legislation in Congress 
that would constitute the first federal law to directly address spam. We 
believe e-mail is no more intrusive than direct mail, telemarketing or 
TV advertising when it comes to politicians seeking to reach voters. A 
simple link in good e-mail campaigns allows recipients to opt out of 
future mailings. Direct mail takes at least a phone call or stamp to be 
taken off a list, and viewers must repeatedly endure TV ads.

When a candidate lacks a large campaign war chest, he or she can use the 
Internet to provide constituents with information to better prepare them 
to perform their civic duty of casting educated votes. With more than 60 
percent of all potential voters in this country possessing e-mail 
accounts, it makes sense that political candidates use this medium.

Candidates might avoid some of the tactical problems encountered by the 
Jones campaign if they use the technologies available today that better 
ensure quality of e-mail lists and target content to specific recipient 
groups.

But the broader point remains. When a political candidate sends a voter 
an e-mail, that recipient can choose to delete the message without 
opening it, unsubscribe from the list, read it or even reply and engage 
the sender. That choice should belong to the voter -- not to anti-spam 
advocates whose efforts are better focused on commercial e-mail. 
Political candidates should be free to communicate with voters as best 
they can, and let voters decide what to do with that information.

Battery pack, huh what???

You dont use batteries for a 1/4 mile run, you use capacitors. MANY times
the energy density, and you can get the energy out fast enough. Note that
the battery packs are fully swapped out for recharging after each run
anyway, just like a gas dragster is refueled, so this wouldnt be cheating.
200 MPH should be no problem.

a Wallahs: India's meal-delivery FedEx,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85494359
Date: Not supplied

Amazing story about the ""dabba wallahs"" -- India's 112-year-old meal-delivery 
system that outdoes FedEx using pictograms, bicycles, and largely illiterate 
(but well-compensated) deliverypeople: 

    As part of the tiffin distribution process, every day the meals are picked 
    up from commuters' homes in Mumbai long after the commuters have left for 
    work, delivered to them on time, then picked up and delivered home before 
    the commuters return. 

    Each tiffin carrier has, painted on its top, a number of symbols that 
    identify where the carrier was picked up, the originating and destination 
    stations and the address to which it is to be delivered. 

    After the tiffin carriers are picked up, they are taken to the nearest 
    railway station, where they are sorted according to the destination 
    station. 

    At the destination station they are unloaded by other dabba wallahs and 
    re-sorted, this time according to street address and floor. 

    The 80 kg crates of carriers, carried on dabba wallahs' heads, hand-wagons 
    and cycles are delivered at 12.30 p.m., picked up at 1.30 p.m., and 
    returned when they came. 

    The system relies on multiple relays of dabba wallahs, and a single tiffin 
    box may change hands up to three times during its journey from home to 
    office.

If you dislike Red Hat, why use it ? This was a really bad argument 
against using Red Hat that makes no sense at all.  I for one am GLAD that 
they 
a) don't overwrite your config files on a whim (be GLAD they don't do some 
sort of autodetection and changing crap)
b) tell you on rpm upgrade what config files you should look at because 
formats have changed.

Red Hat is not ""taking it easy"" on this, it's putting control in the hands 
of you, the maintainer of the machine.  Don't be lazy.

You don't need to backup /home if you are careful enough.  You did put 
/home on a separate partition, no ? Just install rh80 and tell it to use 
the same partition as /home and tell it to NOT format it, but keep the 
data as is.

If you didn't put /home on a separate partition, then you really do need 
to make backups.  Use an nfs or smb mount from another machine to backup 
and rsync straight to the mount, or if that's not possible, rsync over 
ssh.  It's the best way to make backups.

> These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! 

It's the other way around - your media files are backups of the CD's they 
came from ;)

Good luck,
Thomas

SA (and other filters) could be configured to ignore the SWE mark if it

SA could also be configured so that SWE marks are ignored in messages that 
look like third-party spam (like stock scams).  Of course, this would still 
mean that ""The U.N. is going to invade America!"" spams with SWE would get 
through.  Probably also need to ignore SWE in messages that look like 
Nigerian scams.

ne in the Sand,"URL: http://www.mozillazine.org/weblogs/hyatt/#85443841
Date: Not supplied

Bug 22056 has to do with enabling different toolbar modes. It's a pretty basic 
browser feature that has been missing from Navigator for years. Even simplified 
browsers like Chimera have this feature. Neil did some excellent work in 22056 
and his code finally landed. It naturally spiked startup time and window time 
slightly, and so it ended up being backed out because of Mozilla's no tolerance 
policy for regressions.

While this ""line in the sand"" policy is in many ways a good one, I feel like it 
misses the point. There is a natural tendency when designing applications to 
add features in every new version of the software. Only rarely do you see 
features removed. With each passing version, you get more and more bloated, 
relying on faster machines and more memory to save the day. Who cares if the 
user interface is now full of 3000 menu items? You still support every last 
feature since version 1.0, so no customers can possibly be dissatisfied!

You can really only cram so many features into a product before its size 
requirements and performance requirements have to change. This is an obvious 
rule. It's like you start with an empty elevator that says ""Capacity: 10 
people."" The elevator stops at the first floor (version 1.0) and a bunch of 
people (features) get on. Continuing on its journey, the elevator stops at the 
second floor, and still more people get on. The elevator is now full, and it 
continues to the third floor (version 3.0). Unfortunately the elevator is full, 
but there are a bunch of people waiting at the third floor to get on. Some of 
them squeeze in anyway, past the fat person from the first floor (the Mozilla 
sidebar feature) who is taking up enough space for 3 people. Everyone wishes 
he'd get off at the third floor or even the fourth floor, but he doesn't. 
Someone (the Mozilla wallet feature) from the second floor cuts one on the way 
to the third floor, so he's useless, and everyone wishes he'd get off too. He 
doesn't though. Nobody does. People keep piling in at floor after floor, until 
eventually the elevator support cable snaps and everybody dies.

We need to forcibly eject people from the elevator. Remove the features that 
nobody wants and replace them with the features that matter. Cull out the 
features that didn't work in Mozilla 1.0 and make sure they aren't there in 
Mozilla 2.0. Make more of the features optional plugins so that geeks who want 
some of the more obscure features (and that have powerhouse machines) can go 
download them on their own. Only if we actively fight the trend towards bloat 
will we finally produce an awesome Mozilla browser.

Lovely quote from the Forbes 400 list:

current Forbes Four Hundred. ""

But you have to studiously ignore the 4 Rockefellers, 3 Gettys, 3 
Hearsts,  Fords, Kelloggs, Wrigleys,
and so on.

There are more self-made people on the list than I previously alluded to 
- I made a mistake. Most
of them seem to have Ivy League educations, or are Ivy League dropouts,

[SAdev] results of scorer evaluation,"Daniel Quinlan wrote:

I don't think there's much more room for lowering FPs left which the GA can 
achieve.  Remember, also, that the AWL will reduce FPs, but its effects aren't 
factored in to the GA scores.

The work currently being done on the GA, and comparing different methods of 
doing the score-setting, is very worthwhile, and extremely useful; however, we 
really ought to get a release out, since 2.31 is getting decreasingly useful as 
time goes on.

The FP/FN rate of 2.40 with pretty well *any* score-setting mechanism will be 
better than 2.31 -- we can continue with adjusting how the scores are set on the 
2.41 or 2.50 branches.

You could just allow low and high to be evolved by the GA (within ranges); I'd 
be enormously surprised if it didn't end up with low=-12 and high=+6, since 
that'd give the GA the broadest lattitude in setting individual scores.  The 
issue with fixing low and high is not one of optimization, but rather one of 
human-based concern that individual scores larger than about +4 are dangerous 
and liable to generate FPs, and individual scores less than -8 are dangerous and 
liable to be forged to generate FNs.

DQ> Maybe even add a nybias loop.

Adding an nybias loop is not worthwhile -- changing nybias scores will just 
alter the evaluation function's idea of what the FP:FN ratio should be.

My concern doesn't stem from failing to understand how your business is
intended to work.  My concern is the lack of empirical evidence that it
will reduce the amount of uncaught spam.

Please don't misquote me.  I did not assert that you ""can't track
spammers"".  Here is what I said:

| various non-friendly countries where spam originates (China is a good
| example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.

I understand the incentive that you have to pursue spammers, but that
does not directly translate to less spam being sent to my inbox.  It is
an indirect effect and the magnitude of the effect may not be sufficient
to counteract the ease with which a -20 score on the mark allows spam to
avoid being tagged as spam.

I think I've worked on SA enough to understand that I can localize a
score.  I'm just not comfortable with using SpamAssassin as a vehicle
for drumming up your business at the expense of our user base.

I think it would make more sense to start Habeas with a less aggressive
score (one which will not give spammers a quick path into everyone's
inbox) and after we've seen evidence that the system works, then we can
increase the magnitude of the score.

mbayes] Deployment,"I think that when considering deployment, a solution that supports all
Python platforms and not just the L|Unix crowd is desirable.

Mac and PC users are more apt to be using a commercial MUA that's unlikely
to offer hooking ability (at least not easily). As mentioned elsewhere, even
L|Unix users may find an MUA solution easier to use then getting it added to
their MTA. (SysOps make programmers look like flaming liberals ;).)

My notion of a solution for Windows/Outlook has been, as Guido described, a
client-server. Client side does pop3/imap/mapi fetching (of which, I'm only
going to implement pop3 initially) potentially on several hosts, spamhams
the incoming mail and puts it into one file per message (qmail style?). The
MUA accesses this ""eThunk"" as a server to obtain all the ham. Spam is
retained in the eThunk and a simple viewer would be used for manual
oversight on the spam for ultimate rejection (and training of spam filter)
and the ham will go forward (after being used for training) on the next MUA
fetch. eThunk would sit on a timer for 'always online' users, but I am not
clear on how to support dialup users with this scheme.

Outbound mail would use a direct path from the MUA to the MTA. Hopefully all
MUAs can split the host fetch/send URL's

IMO, end users are likely to be more intested in n-way classification. If
this is available, the ""simple viewer"" could be enhanced to support viewing
via folders and (at least for me) the Outlook nightmare is over - I would
use this as my only MUA. (N.B. according to my recent readings, the best
n-way classifier uses something called a ""Support Vector Machine"" (SVM)
which is 5-8% more accurate then Naive Bayes (NB) ).

I wonder if the focus of spambayes ought not to be a classifier that leaves
the fetching and feeding of messages to auxillary code? That way, it could
be dropped into whatever harness that suited the user's situation.

The associated links cover that: The surface temperature in spots

reporting global warming) although the overall environmental

Apparently, the real news is not that there is no global warming, but
that our models of the warming were seriously flawed by naive

Zimbabwe eases GM stance

Zimbabwe has dropped objections to accepting genetically modified (GM) grain
so that urgently-needed food aid can be delivered, says the UN food agency.
The executive director of the World Food Programme, James Morris, said
Zimbabwe's decision would send an important message to other countries in
the region which have refused food aid because it might contain GM grain.
Until now, Zimbabwe had said it would only allow aid workers to distribute
ground maize to allay fears that GM grain could be planted.
But a Zimbabwean minister says the government has now set up a system of
checks to ensure the grain will not enter the eco-system.
There have been fears that Southern African nations could lose lucrative
export markets in Europe if they cannot certify that their crops are
GM-free.
Aid
Mr Morris announced the policy reversal after talks in Harare with
Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe.
""The fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in
accepting GM crops or commodities will be an important signal to other
countries in the region,"" Mr Morris told journalists.
""It will enable us to do our job,"" he said.
Aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in Southern
Africa face famine. In Zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the
region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid.
The WFP says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes
of food it intends to bring into Zimbabwe in the next few months.
The government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's
campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has
worsened the situation, say many donors.
Lost markets
The GM row has complicated relief efforts across the region.
Zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on GM food aid, labelling
it as 'poison' .
Deals to mill GM food before being distributed, so that it could not be
planted, have placated fears in Malawi and Mozambique.
United States aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that
Americans eat GM maize every day.
The World Health Organisation has certified the grain for human consumption
and says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.

osoft buys XDegress - more of a p2p/distributed data thing...,"I like this part - sounds like httpd on the client...

http://www.openp2p.com/pub/a/p2p/2001/04/27/xdegrees.html

""Once the Client Component is installed, a server can order a program to run
on the client. Any CGI script, Java servlet, ASP component, etc. could be
run on the client. This is like breaking the Web server into two parts.
Originally, Web servers just understood HTTP and sent pages. Then the field
started demanding more from the Web and the servers got loaded down with CGI
and mod_perl and active pages and stuff. So now the Web server can choose to
go back to simple serving and (where the application is appropriate) let the
client do the other razzamatazz. This is superior to JavaScript in one
important detail: the program doesn't have to reload when a new page is
loaded, as JavaScript functions do.

And because XDegrees uses Web-compatible technology, users can access
XDegrees resources without installing any software, simply by using their
browser.""

===
""Scaling is the main question that comes to mind when somebody describes a
new naming and searching system. CEO Michael Tanne claims to have figured
out mathematically that the system can scale up to millions of users and
billions of resources. Scaling is facilitated by the careful location of
servers (XDegrees will colocate servers at key routing points, as Akamai
does), and by directing clients to the nearest server as their default
""home"" server. Enterprise customers can use own servers to manage in-house
applications.""

""Files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the
Internet, as with Napster or Freenet. In fact, the caching in XDegrees is
more sophisticated than it is on those systems: users with high bandwidth
connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several
cached locations simultaneously. The XDegrees software then reassembles
these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that
the downloaded file is the same as the original. A key component of this
digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an HTTP header
for the file.""

I don't know whether it suggests that, but they would be tagged differently
in to/cc if I were tagging them at all right now.  If I were tagging To:
addresses, for example, the tokens would look like

    'to:email addr:mit'

    'email addr:mit'

email addresses should be stuck in as one blob or split up as they are now

Sure.  But for most people, changing their company's or ISP's server

Apt repository authentication: it's time,"Once upon a time, Brian wrote :

I don't think gpg signing my repositories will help anything, as it will
just ensure that my passphrase was typed to confirm the md5 signatures of
all pgklists and srclists. Basically, you'll then just be sure that it's me
who generated the files, and this will of course prevent automating the
process of updating the apt repository when Red Hat updates show up.

In Red Hat Linux 8.0 though, the warnings about ""No Key"" appear until you
import the right gpg public keys directly with rpm, for example :
rpm --import /usr/share/doc/apt-0.5.4cnc7/RPM-GPG-KEY
(this will import my key, which is used to sign all freshrpms.net packages)

Hopefully it is possible to the tell rpm to install *only* packages who
verify against an imported gpg key? This for me would be the optimal way to
ensure integrity with the way things curently work.

Just to throw in another approach to solving the same problem. 

I run two copies of exmh, one at work, one at home.  They both
display on a ""virtual X server"" created by vncserver on the home
box.  I connect to that virtual X server using vncviewer wherever
I happen to be.  The VNC connection is tunneled over ssh and is
carried over the Internet via an IPSEC appliance.

That gives me access to both home and work email from either 
place without the complications involved in having two copies of 
exmh working on the same set of folders.

It's a tad slow viewing work email when I'm at work ... but not 
so bad that I can't stand it.

", war in Iraq threaten Disney parks","URL: http://boingboing.net/#85531557
Date: Not supplied

Disney's themepark business is in deep trouble in the post-9/11 world. A war 
with Iraq could really kill 'em: 

    While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit by 
    steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping deliver 
    record profit for Disney year after year. 

    ""The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was something new,"" 
    said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. ""It was an astounding 
    growth period.... Now they're overexposed.""... 

    Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to fall 27% to 
    $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst Katherine Styponias. By 
    2003, she said, the business could climb to $1.49 billion, depending on 
    whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.

Yes, confirmed, but for my part, I'm using mostly non-antialiased fonts

DVD Capture is an AppleScript for OS X that captures screen-grabs from DVDs. OS 
X normally disables screen-capture while the DVD player is running (even if it 
isn't visible!). I have some home movies on DVD that I'd love to get stills 
from, but I can't -- the DVD licensing board has forced Apple to break my 
hardware in such a way as to prevent me from doing something completely lawful,

New Sequences Window,"    Date:        Wed, 21 Aug 2002 10:40:39 -0500
    From:        Chris Garrigues <cwg-dated-1030376441.95dd45@DeepEddy.Com>
    Message-ID:  <1029944441.398.TMDA@deepeddy.vircio.com>

  | The background color in this window is the same as the background 
  | color in the ftoc.

That's what I'd like to vary - particularly as the ftoc background isn't
constant - messages in the unseen sequence have a different background
than others.

In the ftoc that's fine, but in the sequences window, it isn't needed.
unseen already has a different foreground there (no problem with that),
it doesn't need a different background as well.

I'll play about a bit with this, and with making it vertical instead of
horizontal, and see what turns up.

  | The only sequences that are defined there are sequences which are defined
  | in app-defaults-color or ~/exmh/exmh-defaults-color.

OK.

  | I've been thinking about how to dynamically generate highlighting for
  | other sequences, but haven't got that figured out yet.

In this case, highlighting wasn't what I was most concerned about.
A method to get messages in & out of sequences comes first, how it
displays is a secondary consideration.   But as a suggestion, have an
""all unknown"" sequence highlight, any message in a sequence which has
no defined highlighting (where defined includes defined to not be treated
specially) gets highlighted the same way (maybe something as boring as
a dark brown text colour - almost indistinguishable from the normal black)


  | > > Any chance of making the current message a little brighter background?
  | 
  | I don't see any reason why not.  Experiment and let me know what works for you.

Done some of that.   First, the most significant change came from changing
relief from raised to sunken.   I don't know why, but it just looks better
(for me anyway).   But even with that, cur and unseen are still just a
bit too similar.   I ended up using

*sequence_cur:  -background {PaleGoldenrod} -relief sunken -borderwidth 2

The unnecessary braces are just because some of the colours I was using
had spaces in their names.   PaleGoldenrod translates as #eee8aa which
is probably safer for generic use.

------- Additional Comments From easmith@beatrice.rutgers.edu  2002-09-21 16:41 -------
I like this idea, but from my reading - part of my dissertation research -
on GAs (or, in this case, more precisely ""Evolutionary Programming"", since
the parameters are non-binary and the major operator is mutation, not
crossover), you do need to keep in mind that the more interactions there are
between different variables, the better-tweaked the GA/EA will need to be,
especially to avoid local optima (which may have been the problem with the
suspiciously-high ""anti-ratware"" USER_AGENT scores). From past results,
what's needed are one or more of the below:
        A. Determine mutational parameters by adapted-scores themselves,
           with variation on a per-original score basis; ideally, allow
           for having ""correlated"" mutations - in other words, have a
           mechanism in place for trying out changes to a bunch of scores at
           once, with them all moving about the same amount (albeit possibly
           in different directions) - one means to do this is found in the
           ""Evolutionary Strategies"" of Schwefel;
        B. Adapt the probability of a mutation taking place depending on how
           well previous mutation tries have done - if more than about a
           fifth of the new ""individuals"" are doing about as well as, or
           better than, the parental generation, then mutate more
           parameters; if less than a fifth of them are doing about as well
           as, or better than, the parental generation, then mutate less
           parameters.

No, they only have to prove that they send several million
emails to 'potential clients' to get their money.  I don't think
they even care much about bounces.  They're con-artists, why
should they care about proving they actually reached people?

Most of the time the bounce goes to some poor soul who has
nothing to do with the spammer.

While that's not a lot of training data, I picked random subsets of my

It's hard to say whether you need better ham or better spam, but I suspect
better spam <wink>.  18 of the 30 most powerful discriminators here were

HTML tags aren't stripped, and there are lots of these in my spam sets.

That doesn't account for it, though.  If I strip HTML tags out of those too,
the rates are only a little worse:

I suppose it could be much worse;

To be fair, would this mean that they'd
also immediately pay out the difference
for anyone whose tax basis was greater
than current estate value?

Apparently the angle on this (i.e. selling without guarantee) is that
software is not a product which is sold but a service which is licensed - at
least that's what I remember reading about how M$ gets away with providing
no guarantee in the U.S. If you're feeling rather deep pocketed, you could
always try suing M$ to get a court's view on the matter.

Stop Those Presses! Blonds, It Seems, Will Survive After All

October 2, 2002
By LAWRENCE K. ALTMAN 




 

Apparently it fell into the category ""too good to check.""


Last Friday, several British newspapers reported that the
World Health Organization had found in a study that blonds
would become extinct within 200 years, because blondness
was caused by a recessive gene that was dying out. The
reports were repeated on Friday by anchors for the ABC News
program ""Good Morning America,"" and on Saturday by CNN. 

There was only one problem, the health organization said in
a statement yesterday that it never reported that blonds
would become extinct, and it had never done a study on the
subject. 

""W.H.O. has no knowledge of how these news reports
originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the United
Nations based in Geneva, ""but would like to stress that we
have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" 

All the news reports, in Britain and the United States,
cited a study from the World Health Organization - ""a
blonde-shell study,"" as The Daily Star of London put it.
But none reported any scientific details from the study or
the names of the scientists who conducted it. 

On ""Good Morning America,"" Charles Gibson began a
conversation with his co-anchor, Diane Sawyer, by saying:
""There's a study from the World Health Organization, this
is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. Women
and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural
blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth
within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as
brunets."" 

Ms. Sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde.""


Jeffrey Schneider, a spokesman for ABC News, said the
anchors got the information from an ABC producer in London
who said he had read it in a British newspaper. 

In London, The Sun and The Express both reported that
unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in
Scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected
the last true blond to hail from Finland. 

The British accounts were replete with the views of
bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow
blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare
genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an
endangered species. 

Journalists in London said last night that the source of
the reports was probably one of several European news
agencies that are used by the British press, but it
remained unclear which one. 

Tim Hall, a night news editor at The Daily Mail, said the
report was probably distributed by The Press Association,
Britain's domestic news agency. ""Several papers picked it
up,"" he said. 

But Charlotte Gapper, night editor at The Press
Association, said that although it had considered running
the report on Sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking
to the World Health Organization. 

""We didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the
World Health Organization first,"" she said. ""They told us
that report was two years old, and had been covered at the
time. They said it had been picked up again that day by a
German news agency."" 

She added that she did not know which agency the
organization was referring to. 

Dr. Ray White, a geneticist at the University of California
at San Francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for
blond hair ""sounds patently incorrect.""

One thing I _think_ you might be doing slightly wrong is your
specification of prefixes.  --prefix is the directory to be used as root
for _installing_ files.  Typically packages use /usr/local as default
(so binaries might then go in /usr/local/bin, documentation in
/usr/local/doc and so forth).
Normally, I find it sufficient to put --prefix=/usr/local, and do not
further specify things like --exec-prefix.

Maybe you have a special reason for using the prefixes you chose, in
which case ignore me!

I'd make the same remarks about prefixes here.  I would use the command
    ./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local

To get w3 to compile, I think the with-url flag you should use is
    --with-url=/usr/local/share/emacs/site-lisp/
(Assuming you compiled/installed url with --prefix=/usr/local
Since you appear to have installed url in /url/url, configure w3 with
./configure --with-emacs --prefix=/usr/local/ --with-url=/url/url/share/emacs/site-lisp

A command you would have found useful would have been
    find / -name 'url-vars.el' -print
Which would have told you where the url-vars.el file was installed.

A program which is very useful is checkinstall
http://asic-linux.com.mx/~izto/checkinstall/
It allows you to install packages from source while still registering
them in the package management system of your distro (rpm,deb,tgz).
Instead of ""make install"" type ""checkinstall"", and a package is put
together and installed for you.  Makes uninstallation simpler than it
might otherwise be.

lor voices up on what to do with the WTC site,"
http://www.phc.mpr.org/posthost/index.shtml

Dear Garrison,

There are at least six plans about what to do with
""Ground Zero"" in New York. I believe a suitable memorial
surrounded by a lovely park with benches, walkways,
children's playgrounds, possibly some concessions such
as a restaurant, small theater and a place for art works
would be the best tribute to those who lost their lives.
What do you think should done with the space?

Joe Adams
Hillsdale, New Jersey

I dread the thought of a big memorial in Manhattan
that's designed by committee and that's gone through
public hearings and so forth ----- it's going to be cold
and ugly and pretentious and the upshot will be one more
public space that the public hates, of which there are
plenty already. New York is a bustling commercial city
and that's the beauty of it, it's a city of young
ambitious dreamy people, like the folks who died in the
towers, and it's not a memorializing city. Historic
events occurred in New York that in any other city would
be commemorated with interpretive centers and guides and
historical museums and in New York there's barely a
little plaque. That's a great thing, in my estimation.
It's a hustling city, full of immigrants looking for
their big chance, and compared to that spirit of
entrepreneurship, a memorial plaza with a fountain and a
statue of something seems dead to me. Look at Grant's
Tomb. Who walks past it and thinks about President
Grant? Nobody. People sit in the plaza by Grant's Tomb
and think about lunch, about sex, about money, about all
the things that New York is about. If you want to find
Grant, read his memoirs. His monument seems odd in New
York: it belongs in Washington, which is our memorial
city. New York is for the young and lively.

Hm, it is built inside the same chroot.  aviplay works (well it would if I 
had XV, I get X errors ;)).  But it doesn't complain about linker 
problems.  So I suppose my avifile library on itself is compiled ok.

Sigh, avifile is one of the worst packages out there, in all aspects - 
naming of tarballs, not ever releasing an actual package, versioning of 
libraries, API stability, ...

G] semaphores on linux RH7.3,"Hi All,

I have a question which is a bit tricky and was
wondering of anyone has come across this problem
before or could point me in the right direction.

I am involved in porting a SCO unix application to
Linux, and we have encountered a problem with the way
semaphores  are being handled. The application uses
mulitple processes to run application code with the
main process known as the bsh which controls all i/o
be it screen, or file i/o, syncronisation is handled
via semaphores.

In certain circumstances the main process and the
application child process seem to lock up both waiting
for the syncronisation semaphores to change state, I
have attached ddd to the processes and it seems that
the semaphore code is doing the correct things for
syncronisation but the processes stay stuck in the
semop() system call.

I have also noticed that if I introduce a slight delay
between changing semaphore states the problem goes
away, but this causes our entire application to run
really sloooww !! lol

Is there anything weird or different with the standard
implemenation of semaphores on modern linux that could
cause a semop() to fail to pick up the change in state

in a semaphore immediately?

Setting sem_flg = IPC_NOWAIT and checking for errno ==
EAGAIN and recalling semop() if the semop() call fails
(-1) also fixes the problem but again system
performance goes down the toilet.

both the parent controlling process run as the same
uid, and the parent creates the semaphores with
permissions 0666.

Any pointers would be appreciated!

Rgds,

Colin Nevin

Creative Writing,"More articles that support my fantasy that Irvine is the
center of the universe.  We've got the corner on electric
cars, fuel cells, two types of Nobel winning physics,
outside the box computer science, and lot of creative writers.

UCI's creative writing department has been in the 
news a lot over the course of the last decade.  Some
quotes from the article[1]:

   ""In 1992, Newsweek called UCI's fiction writing workshop
    'the hottest writing program in the country.' Now it's
    exponentially hotter, thanks only in part to Sebold's daring
    and uncannily timely novel. 

The novel they are talking about is Alice Sebold's ""The
Lovely Bones"" which is on the way to the top of the 
NY Times best-sellers list.  My uncle used to tease me
about UCI (being a USC graduate from '54) that nobody
knew who UC Irvine was just two states over.  In fact,
I used to refer to UCI as one of the lesser known UC
schools, and when I went off to college in 1985, my
relatives told everyone I was off to Cal State Irvine. 
I took a class as an undergrad by one of the department's 
faculty called ""the art of writing fiction"".   If there
was ever any two classes that helped contributed to writing
my dissertation, it was that one which taught me how to
get the writing flowing and my high school typing class
which taught me how to type really fast.  

One of the advantages they cite in the article is that they
seem to take a chance on the ""not-so-sure"" bet, but according
to the article, the number of UCI graduates that have gone on
to write best sellers and the handful that feed the film industry
is creating a viscious cycle that lures more talent which
creates the right writing ecosystem, which churns out more
success stories which lures more talent.

iness Webforms: cluetrain has left the station,"What's wrong with doing business over the Web?  Web forms.  There's
promising replacements forms, but this is the current state of the
industry:

 o You find something that you want to fill out.  It's a partnership form,
   a signup for a Web seminar, a request for more information, anything.
 o You start wasting time typing in all those stupid fields and spend
   about 10 minutes going through all their stupid qualification hoops
   just to get a small piece of information , whitepaper, or a callback
   when halfway through, you start to wonder if it's really worth your
   time to forever be stuck on their stupid prospect list. 
 o Pull down tags are never put in order of use instead of alphabetized.
   I was on a site just now that had every single country in the world
   listed; the selection of your country was absolutely critical for you
   to hit submit, but due to the layout, the ""more>"" tag on the second
   row was offscreen so it was impossible to select any country except
   about two dozen third world countries. 
 o Even worse, ever time you hit submit, all forms based things complain
   about using the universal country phone number format and will cause
   you to re-enter dashes instead of dots.
 o When you get something that's not entered right, you will go back and
   enter it right, but then some other field or most likely pulldown will
   automatically get reset to the default value so that you will have to
   go back and resent that freaking thing too.  Finally after all combinations
   of all pulldowns, you may get a successful submit.
 o You wait freaking forever just to get a confirmation.  
 o Sometimes, like today, you won't be able to ever submit anything due
   to it being impossible to ever submit a valid set of information that
   is internally non-conflicting according to whatever fhead wrote their
   forms submission.

What's wrong with this picture?  The company is screwing you by wasting
your time enforcing their data collection standards on you.  I'm sure there's
someone in that company that would be willing to accept ""US"", ""U.S"", ""USA""
""United States"", ""U of A"", ""America"", etc. and would know exactly which
freaking country the interested party was from instead of forcing them
to waste even more time playing Web form geography.  

I'm starting to see the light of Passport.  You want more information?  Hit
this passport button.  Voila.  IE6 and Netscape 6,7 have pre-forms sutff,
but I always turn it off because you never know when there's that one field
that you don't want to submit to the person you are submitting to that 
automatically gets sent, i.e. the privacy stuff is well beyond the 
average user who will get screwed on privacy stuff.  

So, if crappy forms-based submission is the state of practice for
business enablement on the Web, I can't see this whole data submission
and hurry up and wait for us to get back to you business process as
working all that well.

That's similar to using hard-locks (either the old parallel, or the new
usb).

The problem is that that piece of hardware is trustworthy, but the rest of
the PC isn't, so a cracker just needs to simulate the lock/smart card, or
peek at the executable after the lock has been deactivated.

Anybody buying a box like this is undoubtledly going to integrate it into their

Blah, blah, blah.  The marketing FUD gets compounded by the Beberg FUD, talk
about 20x bloat.

What gives you the impression that's what they're doing?  That's not what the

Uhhh, fundamentally it's all machine code.  Kelly's comment seems more like
drivel from a clueless marketroid than anything of technical concern.

Having what appears to be a silicon XML router would be a cool thing.  Having
one integrated with your crypto environment would kick ass.  Let it
deserialize/decrypt/repackage the XML before handing it off to the app servers.
The question, of course, is does it work with actual applications in the field
without tremendously reworking them.  Somehow I doubt it...

ged item,"BlogStart: 

**Dublin**: something from the archives.    Daev Walsh forwards an article from
The Irish Digest about ''Billy in the Bowl''.  This story is also immortalised
in an old Dublin song, which in turn was mentioned in a Pogues track.  Billy
was a legless beggar in the alleys of Stoneybatter and Grangegorman (where I
now live) during the 18th century, who discovered a new, but not entirely
legal, way to make money.

BlogEnd: 
LinkText: Billy in the Bowl

From:         daev <hellshaw@fringeware.com>
Subject:      The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler

A story of my new neighbourhood...


The Irish Digest July 1964


The Case of the Stoneybatter Strangler

The handsome, deformed Billy in the Bowl evolved a plan to rob his donors.
Then, one night, he made the biggest mistake of his life 

DUBLIN in the eighteenth century was noted for two things - the
architectural beauty of its public buildings and the large number of
beggars who sought alms in its maze of streets and lanes.  Many of these
beggars relied on visitors and the gentry for their coin, but there was one
who campaigned among the working class.  This was ""Billy In The Bowl""

The strange appellation was derived from the fact that Billy's sole means
of transport was a large bowl-shaped car with wheels.  Seated in this ""
bowl "", the beggar would propel himself along by pushing against the ground
with wooden plugs, one in each hand.

Billy's unusual means of conveyance was vitally necessary, as he had been
born without legs.  Nature, however, had compensated for this by endowing
him with powerful arms and shoulders and, what was most important, an
unusually handsome face.

This was Billy's greatest asset in his daily routine of separating
sympathetic passers-by from their small change.

The cunning young beggar would wait at a convenient spot on one of the many
lonely roads or lanes which were a feature of eighteenth century
Grangegorman and Stoneybatter, until a servant girl or an old lady would
come along.

He would then put on is most attractive smile which, together with his
black curly hair, never failed to halt the females.  The fact that such a
handsome young man was so terribly handicapped physically always evoked pity.

""Billy in the Bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily
owner of a generous number of small coins; what his greed demanded were
substantial sums of money.  The more he managed to get the more he could
indulge in his pet vices - gambling and drinking.

As a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers.
The first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold March evening
as dusk, was falling.  The victim was a middle aged woman who was passing
through Grangegorman Lane on her way to visit friends in Queen Street - on
Dublin's North Quays.

When Billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a
ditch which skirted the lane.  As his unsuspecting victim drew close, the
beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help.

Trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where Billy lay
concealed.  She bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two
powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes.

In a few minutes it was all over.  The woman lay in a dead faint, and Billy
was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's
purse snug in his coat pocket.  An hour after the robbery the woman was
found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her
assailant.  And, as ""Billy in the Bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a
deformed beggar.

Again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting
the place of attack to a different part of Grangegorman or  Stoneybatter.

On one occasion "" Billy in ""the Bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy
servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to
strangle her.  The incident became known as the 11 Grangegorman Lane Murder
and caused a great stir.

Hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months
""Billy in the Bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts.  Around this
period, Dublin's first-ever police force was been mobilised, and the first
case they were confronted with was the Grangegorman lane murder.

Months passed and  ""Billy in the Bowl"" reverted once again to his old
pasttime.  A number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and
robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a
nightly patrol was placed on the district.  But the beggar still rolled
along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected.  Then came the night that
finished Billy's career of crime.

Two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment
after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to
hear shouts for help.  Rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the
ditch.

Billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and
tried to pull her into the ditch.  She proved much too strong for him,
however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp finger-nails.

Meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring.  Pulling out her
large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye.

The screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the
district and brought people dashing to the scene.  Among them was a member
of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning Billy.

""Billy in the Bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but
they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl.  The
Grangegorman-Stoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive
Dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed
and giggled as they wended their way home at night.

heavy on tech details, but you can easily see the potential here. (It's also a 
great way to debug your FOAF file, if you added anything manually.) Now we need 
somebody to build a spider that follows foaf:knows links and draws pretty

Hi Vipul,

I reckon if the ""unwritable log file"" error condition could be caught by
Razor and handled gracefully (logging to syslog or /dev/null), it'd be a
great help.

As it stands, if the log file is unwritable, the razor check falls over
entirely as the constructor returns undef (unblessed reference = 'die'
error in perl).

alk] Thought for RPM/deb/etc packagers,"BTW, I've been thinking a little about the RPMs and other packages.
Already the PLD guys are distributing 3 rpms:

  - perl-Mail-SpamAssassin

          the perl modules.

  - spamassassin

          the ""spamassassin"" and ""spamd"" scripts,
          spamd rc-file etc.

  - spamassassin-tools

          mass-check, masses directory stuff, etc.
          for generating rescore data from corpora.

This seems like a good way to do it; this way, stuff which just needs
the perl modules doesn't need to require the full RPM be installed,
with RC files in init.d etc.

It's been adopted in the distributed .spec file, anyway.

Theo, BTW, what's the eval test you add in the tvd version of the RPM?

zteana] 'Lost' penguins found alive,"Evening Standard - 28 August 2002

[Deft use of Fortean Unit of Measurement in 2nd para - MA]

 'Lost' penguins found alive
 
 by Charles Miranda

 A colony of emperor penguins which was thought to have starved to death in
 Antarctica has been found alive in a ""big huddle"". 

 The birds were spotted by the crew of a USAF jet returning to base in New
 Zealand. Researchers had feared that a breakaway iceberg the size of Jamaica
 had all but wiped out the colony at Cape Crozier on Ross Island. 
 
 Thousands of chicks are believed to have died as an increase in sea ice made
 it impossible for the adults to find food. A detailed count is planned in
 October. Antarctica (New Zealand) chief executive Lou Sanson said: ""The
 penguins were in a big huddle. We can now hope that the emperors have had a
 successful breeding season over the winter."" 
 
 Some 1,000 pairs of emperors - the largest penguins in the world at 3.3ft tall
 and 88lb - usually nest at Cape Crozier, 50 miles from the US McMurdo research
 station. The 200,000-strong Adelie penguin colony, which also nests at the
 cape, may have lost up to third of its population.

testing packages,"Hi,

Just the kind of announce I make once in a while :
- I've rebuilt a new ""alsaplayer"" package based on Angle's one.
- I've rebuilt a hopefully final version ""-fr8"" of the ""alsa-driver"" and
  ""alsa-kernel"" packages which fix all known SMP build issues.

Both can be found here :
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/alsa/

I've also repackaged gkrellm 2.0.2 with at last a separate package for the
server that can be installed standalone and doesn't even require glib2.
http://ftp.freshrpms.net/pub/freshrpms/testing/gkrellm/

Last but not least, my latest proftpd 1.2.6 package incorporates some nifty
new features : You can use any of ""--with ldap"", ""--with mysql"" and ""--with
postgres"" when rebuilding the source rpm with rpmbuild to enable desired
extra authentication methods and all package requirements are set
accordingly, and the release tag is changed too.
http://valhalla.freshrpms.net/ (the usual place ;-))

I think I'll use this ""--with <whatever>"" switch more and more where
possible. Some other of my package already use it like the xmame for its
output targets, sqlrelay for its modules and my latest sylpheed claws spec
to enable Pilot support.

As usual, feedback and comments are welcome! :-)

Well, in sylheed's ""claws"" branch you need to wait a bit for the developers

zteana] US Army tests portable translator,"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/2219079.stm

US soldiers on peacekeeping duties in the future could find that a portable
translation device will be an essential part of their equipment. 
Scientists at Carnegie Mellon University have developed a prototype of a
speech translator that was road-tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

""This project shows how a relatively simple speech-to-speech translation
system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,""
said the team from Carnegie Mellon University in a research paper published
recently. 

The research was commissioned by the US Army, which is increasingly finding
itself in peace-keeping roles where communication is key. 

Speaking in tongues 

""In the Balkans, the Army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" Robert
Frederking of Carnegie Mellon University told the BBC programme Go Digital. 

 
Translators could be essential for US soldiers
 
""In a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up
and you are holding them apart. 

""You can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and
talk to them,"" he said. 

The portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially
available laptops. 

The Army did not want to field-test the device in a battlefield situation.
So instead the translator was tested by US Army chaplains in Croatia. 

""The chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and
typically don't have any translation support,"" explained Mr Frederking. 

Slow system 

For the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to Croatians who
knew just a smattering of English. 

The system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in
Croatian, turns the speech into text. The written words are then translated
into English and read out by a speech synthesizer. 

""It went reasonably well half the time,"" said Mr Frederking, though it was
slow in translating phrases. 

The research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the
field. 

But they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to
work with further research and development. 

The Audio Voice Translation Guide System project was a joint venture between
the US Army, the military manufacturer Lockheed Martin and Carnegie Mellon
University.

"e trying to decide if FogBUGZ 3.0 should support custom
    fields. Histor","URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20020912.html
Date: Not supplied

We're trying to decide if FogBUGZ[1] 3.0 should support custom fields. 
Historically, I am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get 
abused. People add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything 
they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to Harvard. 
End result: people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not 
capturing all that information. You can always ""page fault"" to get the 
information if the original report forgot it. Rather than having a field in 
every bug where you enter the version numbers of every DLL on your machine 
(this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be 
relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the 
programmer-assignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be 
dll-version-related, only _then_ bounce the bug back to the originator asking 
for the DLL info? Similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you 
ask for the OS version in which the bug occurred. This sounds logical, but 
trust me: adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing 
only: reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first 
place. Only a small percentage of bugs are really OS dependant and you can 
always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be 
relevant. (But then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on 
Windows 98SE? Aha! You can't. Ever. Even with the custom field. Because not 
every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so 
this search doesn't make sense in the first place. The info wasn't captured. Do 
a full text search for 98SE and you'll find some of them. Life is imperfect.) 

Life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of 
information -- a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in RAM on 
the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's 
workspace. But the goal of a bug tracking database is to _keep track of bugs_, 
which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. I 
have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking 
package was so high-ceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the 
system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. The _real_ 
bug-""tracking"" happened in email, post-its, and hallway conversations. Great. 

A pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does 
FogBUGZ support custom fields?"" Rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on 
purpose."") over the last few weeks I've been saying, ""can you please tell me 
what fields you would need? We're trying to decide whether to implement that 
feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" The interesting thing 
is, almost all of the fields people ask for _are already in FogBUGZ,_ and the 
other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. And in fact, our 
existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. One of our 
biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and I myself wanted 
to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, 
but I didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track 
of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are 
happy and keep buying more site licenses. 

But the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking 
software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in 
our product. ""Gosh, even Filemaker has custom fields."" Righto. It's true. And 
who am I to tell my customers they are wrong? One person who I was talking to 
yesterday would have used a custom field for something that we already have a 
built-in field for. This would have made their database confusing and 
inconsistent and would have definitely caused more problems than it solved. But 
it's still rude of me to tell customers that we don't have that feature _for 
their own good_, even though it usually is, and we're losing some sales because 
of it. 

Sigh. I guess we could have a custom fields feature but hide it and make it so 
hard to use that people don't use it. At least we won't lose any sales :)

_Jeffrey Zeldman_: OS X Blues update[1]. 

    A couple of intellectuals have pointed out parallels between the rigidity 
    of OS X, which derives its power from Unix and XML, and the rules of 
    standards-based web development, which also compels you to do things the 
    right way instead of using five different non-standard hacks. The parallel 
    is not without merit. Building web pages the right way is hard at first, 
    but once you get it, you never want to go back. Regardless, we miss OS 9's 
    flexibility and ease of use, and a metric ton of logic doesn't offset that 
    feeling of loss.

rd industry defends practices to Senate,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85513221
Date: Not supplied

The Joint Hearing of the Senate Committee and Senate Select Committee on the 
Entertainment Industry is underway in LA, investigating artists' claims that 
the labels engage in unfair and corrupt business-practices. The first day's 
findings at the hearings are really quite remarkable: 

    By contract, artists are prohibited from showing royalty statements to 
    third parties. Normally this would not include their mangers, lawyers, 
    consultants, or others who could aid them in getting paid, but apparently 
    this is not necessarily the case. Senator Kevin Murray, leading the 
    initiative for artists' rights, claimed the that Cary Sherman, Chief 
    Counsel for the RIAA himself, said to him in an interview, that RIAA 
    members (the major labels) would sue any artist that broke ranks and shared 
    information with the Committee. This claim was rejected by Sherman but 
    supported by others in the room. Don Henley, among them, outwardly dared 
    his record company to sue him for bringing royalty statements to the 
    hearing. He presented his most recent royalty statement for ""Hell Freezes 
    Over,"" which showed the panel that even though his contract called for a no 
    more than a 10% ""reserve"" on sales of records shipped, Universal Music had 
    held back more than that for eleven pay periods (roughly under three years) 
    and that, even though his contract calls for no free goods in Europe, they 
    had deducted $87,000 in free goods charges to Europe.

s Ian interviewed on Slashdot,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85482094
Date: Not supplied

Janis Ian, a brave and talented recording artist (and budding and talented 
science fiction writer) has done a terrific interview with the Slashdot 
groupmind about her views on the music industry. 

    Seriously, diversity is something record companies can't afford anymore - 
    not the majors, at any rate. I'd go to this article, posted at Linux 
    Journal, which quotes a Newsweet article (July 15,2002) by Steven Levy 
    saying ""So why are the record labels taking such a hard line? My guess is 
    that it's all about protecting their Internet-challenged business model. 
    Their profit comes from blockbuster artists. If the industry moved to a 
    more varied ecology, independent labels and artists would thrive--to the 
    detriment of the labels, which would have trouble rustling up the rubes to 
    root for the next Britney. The smoking gun comes from testimony of an 
    RIAA-backed economist who told the government fee panel that a dramatic 
    shakeout in Webcasting is ""inevitable and desirable because it will bring 
    about market consolidation."" That's really it in a nutshell. ""Market 
    consolidation"" means the less artists they have to promote, the less 
    ultimate dollars they'll spend. The smaller the playlist, the greater the 
    chance that audiences will buy something from that playlist alone - because 
    that's all you'll be able to find out there.

The Curse of India's Socialism,"I think that this and other articles confuse Socialism with 
Bureaucracy.  Libertarianism as implemented in North America is not 
exactly the shining pinnacle of economic efficiency.

Just try starting a telephone company in the US or (even worse) 
Canada.  It can take a year or more to get the blessing of our own 
""Permit Rajs"" at the FCC, PUC, and PTTs (or, in the decidedly more 
socialist leaning Canada, Industry Canada and the CRTC).

Yet, despite all of this intense regulation and paper pushing, as 
well as regulatory scrutiny by the FTC, SEC, and IRS, the 
executives of Telecom Companies have managed to bilk the investment 
community for what looks to be tens of billions of dollars.  They 
finished their routine with the a quadruple lutz -- laying off 
hundreds of thousands of workers when it all came crashing down.

So.. tell me again.. how are we better off?

-Ian.

FWIW, I would now recommend doing this (using a user with a procmailrc)
instead of a system alias; more secure, and easier to filter out crud
like bounces, virii etc. that render a corpus dirty.

I guess/hope some other people from the list will try it out ;-)

Both problems you reported (libasound.so and wrong xine dependency) are now
fixed in the current packages.

Oh, it's maybe also worth pointing out : I've implemented at last sorting
by both last change date and alphabetically for my ""build list"" in the php
code : http://freshrpms.net/builds/

And yes, I accept patches/comments/suggestions about all those spec files!

I think it's like P3P met whatever commercial /.like forum was rocking
yesterday, and they took all Greg's extra serotonin and lit up and
made a Successful go of personal address palettes you could occupy and
own or rent and even move or sell.  So you'd reply to all the whitepaper
sites you wouldn't just call to get the real deal like: 'Okay, let's say
I'm in Factorytown, GuangZhou, and I'm a battery acid supervisor for
a multinational that sometimes buys B1s.  e-mail me if you get your story
written up all the way;' or

Could this be as simple as a modified molecular structure where the
humanoid cells are in fact exo-skeletally structured with more atoms
per cubic angstrom to achieve the distance-squared tensile strength
enhancements we find when we introduce smaller metal atoms between the
lattice packed grid of iron atoms to create steel?  

This 'steel-effect' might give bone structure and tendons dramatically
(several orders of magnitude) more tensile strength without the need
to significantly increase the weight (like magnesium-alloy or
carbon-fiber weight compared to iron, Spidey could even be way under
weight).  Only increasing tensile strength could accommodate the
mobility and leverage feats since bones are actually formed from
bubbles of organic material hydrolically assisted, tensile strength
cross-sectionally would give his frame the strength to withstand the
muscular enhancement.

    E> As for the spidey senses, well they're really great, but AFAIK
    E> not really well explained in the comic series. 

If the same close-packing gap-filling arachne-molecular structure
modification occurs in neural tissues, and there'd be no reason to
think that these would grow differently from bones and tendons, then
what we are seeing in spidey sense is no more than the heightened
cerebral functions due to shorter/faster/stronger synapses throughout
the entire nervous system.  

Since we know dogs and cats measure human emotions by smell, clearly
hearing the heartbeats, and other subtle clues within their normal
sensory ranges (but seem mystical to us) ...  for Peter Parker,
everything from air currents on his facial-hairs to extremely subtle
hormone smells might coallesce into a general gestalt of Spidey-Sense;
don't forget that he'd acquired this ability in adolescence and thus
would lack any cultural or even pathological basis to explain the
heightened awareness to himself in anything but mystical terms. We
know from issue #1 that his collision-avoidance reflex response time
was far swifter than his cognitive awareness since he 'found' himself
already stuck to the tree when the bicycle was already past and hence
his disorientation (""You ok, Mister?"") as if it was a hallucination.

Hmmm ... it may even be physio-psychologically interesting to examine
if Peter Parker's personal quandries arose _because_ his physiological
'Spidey' infrastructure had been advanced whereas his psychological
perception of his self had not, ie, ""Peter"" was not ""Spiderman"" but
just the ""driver of the bus"".  Only, unlike ourselves, he found his
self driving a body-vehicle not evolutionarily matched to his
cognitive time-scales.

ng Love - Another legacy of the 60's,"Normally, I disdain any kind of mysticism, even when it is associated 
with fairly good ideas.  Just a big turnoff.  A good example would be 
the difference between Yoga/TM and the more scientifically pure, but 
related, relaxation techniques including ""betagenics"", 
hypnosis/auto-hypnosis, etc.  (This was one of the many topics I 
obsessively absorbed as a teenager.)  Or Tai Chi etc. vs. Tai Bo / 
G-Force Dyno-Staff.

I have to say however that, having found this while looking for 
something completely unrelated, it has some cute truisms.  I 
particularly like their addiction to non-addiction.  Additionally, the 
Mindprod treehugger site has some interesting quotes, etc.

To my internal ear, nearly all of these 60's based new-age vernacular 
seem to assume that you are a simple child (of the 60's?) who needs some 
religion-like couching of ideas to relate and internalize.  Very 
irritating, but taken in small doses it's interesting to compare and 
contrast with our (my) modern mental models.

I found that a few of the principles could be used to explain and 
justify US/UN foreign policy and actions.

Hey, look at that!

Claim:   President George W. Bush proclaimed, ""The problem with
the French is that they don't have a word for entrepreneur.""

Status:   False.

Origins:   Yet another French fried ""George W. Bush is dumb""
story has been taken up by those who like their caricatures
drawn in stark, bold lines. According to scuttlebutt that
emerged in the British press in July 2002, President Bush,
Britain's Prime Minister Tony Blair, and France's President
Jacques Chirac were discussing economics and, in particular,
the decline of the French economy. ""The problem with the
French,"" Bush afterwards confided in Blair, ""is that they don't
have a word for entrepreneur.""

The source was Shirley Williams, also known as the Baroness
Williams of Crosby, who claimed ""my good friend Tony Blair"" had
recently regaled her with this anecdote in Brighton.

Lloyd Grove of The Washington Post was unable to reach Baroness
Williams to gain her confirmation of the tale, but he did
receive a call from Alastair Campbell, Blair's director of
communications and strategy. ""I can tell you that the prime
minister never heard George Bush say that, and he certainly
never told Shirley Williams that President Bush did say it,""
Campbell told The Post. ""If she put this in a speech, it must
have been a joke.""

This is far from the first time Bush has been made the butt of
a jibe meant to showcase what some perceive as his less than
stellar intellectual abilities. Without straining our memories
too hard, we can come up with three other instances we've
chronicled on this site. In the summer of 2001, the joke of the
moment centered upon a supposed study that had resulted in the
ranking of Presidential IQs, with George W. Bush being pegged
as the Chief Executive who scraped the bottom of the
intelligence barrel. In December 2000 it was a fake Nostradamus
quatrain which pontificated that the ""village idiot"" would win
the 2000 Presidential election. And in the spring of 2002, it
was the story of Bush's waving at Stevie Wonder that set folks
to chortling up their sleeves.

Stories that illustrate this widely believed intellectual
shortcoming will always waft after George W. Bush because they
seemingly confirm what many already hold as true about this
public figure, that he's not the brightest fellow that's ever
been. It is human nature to revel in yarns that the hearer at
some level agrees with, thus tales of this sort will always
fall upon appreciative ears.

The GPL and similar licences are explicitly permanent grants of rights
attached to an instance of his work.  (The other stuff mentioned
concerns contract law, e.g., the required element of privity, etc.)

> In the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right

No, the author has the right to issue _additional_ instances under a
different licence, such as a proprietary (""closed"" [sic]) licence.

The analysis, here and elsewhere, concerns contract law.  This isn't

zteana] Fake bank website cons victims,">>From the BBC website - www.bbc.co.uk

 Tuesday, 8 October, 2002, 09:43 GMT 10:43 UK 

 Fake bank website cons victims
 
 West African criminals have used a fake version of a British bank's online
 service to milk victims of cash, say police. The fake site was used to squeeze
 more money out of people they had already hooked. 
 
 The site has been shut down. But UK National Criminal Intelligence Service,
 (NCIS), said at least two Canadians had lost more than $100,000 after being
 taken in by the fake website. 
 
 The scam behind the fake web domain was the familiar one that offers people a
 share of the huge sums of money they need moved out of various African
 nations. 
 
 NCIS said the use of the web was helping the conmen hook victims that would
 otherwise spot the scam. 
 
 Convincing site 
 
 News of this latest scam was revealed by BBC Radio5Live. It found that an
 unclaimed web domain of a UK bank had been used by conmen to get more cash out
 their victims. 

 A NCIS spokesman said the domain looked legitimate because it had ""the"" in
 front of the bank's name. 
 
 ""I have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,"" said the NCIS
 spokesman. ""It's very convincing especially to people not very experienced
 online."" 
 
 Once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. However, the people
 behind it have not been caught. 
 
 NCIS does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. 
 
 The bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many
 other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. 

 Domain games 
 
 Usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as Advanced Fee or
 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or e-mail offering a share of any
 cash successfully moved out of Africa. 
 
 The '419' refers to the part of the Nigerian penal code dealing with such
 crimes. 
 
 Like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking
 the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe
 uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. 
 
 Although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to
 it. 
 
 NCIS estimates that up to five Americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in
 London everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. 
 
 Cutting edge fraud 
 
 Often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of
 legitimacy. 
 
 
 People tricked into clicking on fake sites
 
 But a spokesman for NCIS said fake or spoof websites are now being used in
 place of the certificates. 
 
 ""To many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web
 technology,"" said the spokesman. 
 
 One of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website
 that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the South African
 Reserve Bank, the country's national bank. 
 
 Typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to
 visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has
 been deposited in their name. 
 
 But before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically
 asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. 
 
 Once the South African police discovered the ruse they declared it a national
 priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. 
 
 Modern gloss 
 
 An briefing paper prepared by NCIS in August on organised crime noted that
 criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give
 old cons a modern gloss. 
 
 The NCIS spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come
 forward and help it track down the perpetrators. He said in the last two
 months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. 
 
 He said any e-mail, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be
 true, undoubtedly is. 
 
 One of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment
 service Paypal. 
 
 Conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and re-enter their account
 and credit card details because Paypal had lost the information. 
 
 The website link included in the e-mail looked legitimate but in fact directed
 people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.

Point the first, I doubt if they are trying to change Rumsy's mind but
rather to show others that there is a vocal and violent opposition to his
views. With such flagrant showings of opposition there would be more
coverage of the opposing ideas and thus the spreading of the dissenting
meme. A viri need not comply with the wishes of the attacked host, rather
the host had better make some antibodies or learn to adapt.

Point the second. Historicaly the ""in yer face"" mode of confrontation has
been used to gain popular support and to grow from seeds ""grass roots""

""in yer  face"" Declaration of the american colonies to the governing

mbayes] testing results,"Neil trained a classifier using 3 sets with about 500 ham and spam in each.
We're missing half his test run results due to a cmp.py bug (since fixed);
the ""before custom fiddling"" figures on the 3 reported runs were:

    false positive percentages
        0.187
        0.749
        0.780
    total unique fp 19

    false negative percentages
        2.072
        2.448
        0.574
    total unique fn 43

The ""total unique"" figures counts all 6 runs; it's just the individual-run
fp and fn percentages we're missing for 3 runs.

Jeremy reported these ""before custom fiddling"" figures on 4 sets with about
600 ham and spam in each:

    false positive percentages
        0.000
        1.398
        1.398
        0.000
        1.242

    false negative percentages
       10.413

        5.206
        5.027
        9.874
    total unique fn 970

So things are clearly working much better for Neil.  Both reported
significant improvements in both f-n and f-p rates by folding in more header
lines.  Neal added Received analysis to the base tokenizer's header
analysis, and Jeremy skipped the base tokenizer's header analysis completely
but added base-subject-line-like but case-folded tokenization for almost all
header lines (excepting only Received, Data, X-From_, and, I *suspect*, all
those starting with 'x-vm').

When I try 5 random pairs of 500-ham + 500-spam subsets in my test data, I
see:

    false positive percentages
        0.000
        0.000

        0.400
        0.000
        0.600
    total unique fn 36

This is much closer to what Neil saw, but still looks better.  Another run
on a disjoint 5 random pairs looked much the same; total unique fp rose to
12 and fn fell to 27; on a third run with another set of disjoint 5 random
pairs, likewise, with fp 12 and fn 40.  So I'm pretty confident that it's
not going to matter which random subsets of 500 I take from my data.

It's hard to conclude anything given Jeremy's much worse results.  If they
were in line with Neil's results, I'd suspect that I've over-tuned the
algorithm to statistical quirks in my corpora.

",Ham
of base image / delta image for automated recovery from attacks,"Hi,

I was inspired by a mode of operation supported by VMWare. You can have a
base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. That base
image is never altered by a vm instance. Instead, each vm instance writes
changes to its own ""redo"" log. Future hard disk reads from that vm instance
incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the
current disk image for that specific virtual machine.

This is described here (thanks to Duane for providing this link on the
honeypots mailing list)
http://www.vmware.com/support/reference/common/disk_sharing.html

Could this basic concept be used to easily make self-fixing client/server
applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks,
even before those attacks have been discovered? Here is what I imagine.

The physical architectures of most production client/server systems are
layered. For example, your basic web application might have a web server
running Apache, connected to an application server running some J2EE or .Net
business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. The only one
of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database
server, and even here you often put the static RDBMS software on one
partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. It is only the
partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from
one boot to the next. Other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap
space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot.

When someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that
shouldn't be changed. E.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in IIS or
Apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. But
what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or
""redo"" partition? And then what if every night it automatically erased the
redo partition and rebooted? The downtime involved for each machine would be
minimal, because it is only deleting data - rather than restoring from
backup. In a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high
availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is
always accessible. This base/redo partition concept could be implemented at
the same level as a feature of hardware RAID, allowing for greater
performance, reliability, and hack resistance. This concept could also be
applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions
(except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.)

Does anyone do this already? Or is this a new concept? Or has this concept
been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that I don't yet know?
I use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in
this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server
systems. It would allow for the hardware-separation of volatile and
non-volatile disk images. It would be analogous to performing nightly
ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or
no) downtime.

Thanks for any opinions,
Ben

It was clear you were talking about averages. But it should

Not at all. There are still people who only have one partner.
There are many more whoe only have one partner over ""long""
periods of time. So it is far from ""vacuous"" to describe some
people as ""promiscuous"" and others as ""not promiscuous"", 
especially over a set period. (""He was promiscuous in college.
He is no longer promiscuous."")

The word has a clear meaning, despite your continuing tendency 
to gloss that meaning over with population averages.

OK, then. Consider a population of 1,000,000. 500,000 men each
pair off with 500,000 women. Then, 1 man, let's call him ""Wilt"",
also has sex with the other 499,999 women. 

499,999 women have had more than one partner. 499,999 men have
only had one partner. It is now ""perfectly obvious"" that in the
common meaning of the term, among this contrived population, 
that women are ""more promiscuous"" than men -- even though the
single ""most promiscuous"" person, Wilt, is a man.  

""Promiscuity"" is not ""exactly, perfectly identical between males 
and females"", except under a degenerate custom definition of
""promiscuity"".

Averages are useful, sure -- but much more so if called by their 
actual name, rather than conflated with another concept.

That's very perceptive of you.  Many people are not so willing to
accept their personal reality as skewed by their neuro-physiology.  A
great many popular con games exist by exploiting the perceptions of
these states.

er Hiptop reviewed,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85511986
Date: Not supplied

The T-Mobile Sidekick -- the first commercial implementation of the wonderful 
Danger Hiptop PDA/phone -- is now onsale and the reviews are starting to 
appear. As soon as I'm in San Francisco for more than a couple days straight, I 
really think I'm going to pick this up. 

    That's partly because it costs less than half as much as its current 
    competitors -- $199, compared with $450 and up for the others. In the same 
    spirit, T-Mobile will offer unlimited data usage on its new, relatively 
    high- speed ""GPRS"" network for $40 per month -- far below what a serious 
    surfer would likely rack up under competing wireless-data plans. (Voice 
    time is another story -- more on that later.) 

    Another reason I like the Sidekick's prospects: It was designed for, and 
    will be pitched to, a very different market. While vendors of the competing 
    hybrids focus on ""enterprise"" customers -- the big businesses that are 
    supposed to have deep pockets for this sort of thing (even though most 
    clearly don't at this point) -- Danger and T-Mobile are targeting, in their 
    own words, ""Internet-savvy, primarily urban, young adults in the 18- to 
    34-year-old demographic."" 

I am that demographic! Link[1] Discuss[2] (_Thanks, Steve[3]!_)

 Ah, they told me that about my A1200. Just got a video box, cut air holes
and a hole for the cables, then got an extra-long 2.5"" to 3.5"" IDE cable,
and connected it up. Had to make a few holes in the A1200 case for the
IDE cable too.

 Worked a charm. Until I dropped the disk one day onto concrete.

ne contents of Electronic Publishing journal,"I recently stumbled across the contents of the journal, ""Electronic
Publishing"", which was published from January, 1988 through December, 1995.
All papers are available online in PDF (this was apparently one of the first
journals to disseminate in PDF, in 1994). The journal also reprints some of
the better papers from the Electronic Publishing conferences, held bi-yearly
from 1986-1992 (EP86, EP88, EP90, EP92).

http://cajun.cs.nott.ac.uk/compsci/epo/papers/epoddtoc.html

Today's reader might look at the contents and wonder about their relevance,
since they don't directly discuss the Web. As an academic, I find this
journal valuable, since the papers are of generally high quality (by top
researchers), and they provide lots of pointers to the evolution of the
ideas that led to many Web technologies.  It's one source among many for
sifting through the intellectual lineage of electronic publishing
technologies.

Rohit and Adam might find the following papers especially relevant, in the
context of their WWW7 ""Evolution of Document Species"" paper:

Page Description Languages: Development, Implementation and Standardization:
A. L. Oakley and A. C. Norris

Gillmor responds to Jack Valenti,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85506950
Date: Not supplied

Dan Gillmor interviewed Jack Valenti[1] last week in his column and did the 
impartial thing, representing Valenti's beliefs as fairly as possible. This 
week, Dan takes Valenti's arguments apart, looking at what Hollywood's agenda 
really entails: 

    So the movie and music companies are going back to Congress for another 
    helping. They are asking for laws that would force technology innovators to 
    restrict the capabilities of devices -- cripple PCs and other machines that 
    communicate so they can't make copies the copyright holders don't 
    explicitly allow. Amazingly, the entertainment industry also wants 
    permission to hack into networks and machines they believe are being used 
    to violate copyrights. 

    Here is what it all means. To protect a business model and thwart even the 
    possibility of infringement, the cartel wants technology companies to ask 
    permission before they can innovate. The media giants want to keep 
    information flow centralized, to control the new medium as if it's nothing 
    but a jazzed-up television. Instead of accepting, as they do today, that a 
    certain amount of penny-ante infringement will occur and then going after 
    the major-league pirates, they call every act of infringement -- and some 
    things that aren't infringement at all -- an act of piracy or stealing. 
    Saying it doesn't make it so.

Wifi query,"802.11b - 11Mbps per channel over three channels in the 2.4GHz range 
(also shared with microwaves and cordless phones) at rages up to ~300 ft.
802.11a runs on 12 channels in the 5GHz range and up to around five 
times more bandwidth (~54Mbps or so) but has less range (60-100 ft). 
8021.11a also adds Forward Error Correction into the scheme to allow for 
more reliable data transmission.
Which to use really depends on what you're doing with it. Streaming 
video almost necessitates 802.11a, while streaming just audio can be 
comfortably done with 802.11b provided that there isn't much 
interference or too many clients.
Prices? Don't know... Haven't done the research. For covering a large 
area 802.11a will be more expensive due to the need for more APs. If you 
want to reach the local coffee shop, however, you will need a 
directional antenna either way.

Check out http://www.80211-planet.com, they've got some good articles on 
802.11... Also, some of the best info on 802.11 security I've seen can 
be found at http://www.drizzle.com/~aboba/IEEE/.

bad focus/click behaviours,"It's all here in these 10 lines, otherwise known as the
""I'll try my damnest to paste something"" procedure:

# Return the current selection (from any window) or cut buffer 0.

        }
    }
    return $sel
}

This is in textSelection.tcl, and is what exmh uses to find text to paste.
It is that last ""cutbuffer get"" that is wacky, because exmh sticks its
own deletions into that little know stash, and is probably the only
application on the planet that still looks there.  We should probably
just disable that - try this variant:

proc Text_Selection {} {
    if [catch {selection get} sel] {
        if [catch {selection get -selection CLIPBOARD} sel] {
            return """"

Everything funnels through here, so you just need to hack this one spot.

The WSJ has published a round-up of phone companies, wired and wireless, 
ranking them based on performance and price. They don't mention Nextel, whose 
hullking milspec i700 handset I've been carrying for years now, with incredible 
reception all over the US and Canada. Their front-line customer service sucks, 
but the prices and network can't be beat. 

    T-Mobile is in the midst of a massive makeover. In recent months, the 
    company changed its name and launched an ad campaign featuring Ms. Zeta 
    Jones. 

    The company has a history worth hiding. T-Mobile, a subsidiary of Deutsche 
    Telekom, is known for having a weak national network, and the FCC received 
    1,466 complaints about the company in the past year, giving it one of the 
    worst complaint rates in the industry. T-Mobile says their complaint rate 
    has tapered off and that they have made substantial network improvements. 

    But T-Mobile is the cheapest wireless provider, available, with an average 
    cost of just 8.2 cents per minute. (Verizon, by contrast, costs 14.3 cents 
    per minute.)

This sounds like something piggy in the 'flist' code - I'm seeing flist

fast, there might be a borkedness in 8.4.

I've been seeing this as well - *usually* with inbox, but it's gotten

Most likely in the added overhead of managing more sequences.

I'm sure it can be tuned a bunch, but as I'm leaving for a vacation on Friday, 
and have plenty of ""real work"" to do, I won't be able to do much until I get 
back.

I *will* look at all this when I get back, but if you want to check into

_Heather Hamilton_: Very Best of the World's Worst[1]. &#8220;After watching 
last night's premiere of ""The Very Best of the World's Worst Drivers: 2"" I 
tried to figure out what it was about these very best worst drivers that made 
them the very best, but not really _the_ very best, because if they really were 
_the_ very best, wouldn't they have been featured on ""The Very Best of the 
World's Worst Drivers: 1"" ?&#8221;

Ah.  Neither Ted nor I were particularly up to date.  I pulled 
down the lates from CVS and am now running with it.  I miss the 
blue ftoc lines but I'll sort that out soon, iirc Chris said 
it's a simple resource change.

Ted's code to ""ketchup"" made use of some of the procs that went 
away in the sequence generalization.  I've fixed it up... almost 
and it looks like this now:

proc Cabeen_Mark2CurSeen {} {
    global exmh mhProfile msg
    set results {}
    Exmh_Status ""Clearing unseen up to cur..."" red
    Mh_SetCur $exmh(folder) $msg(id)

         if { $elem <= $msg(id) } {
            lappend results $elem
         }
    }
    busy Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results
    Exmh_Status ok blue
}


The ""almost"" is because it's not updating the highlighting on 
the ftoc.  I'm too tired to go figure out how to fix that just 
now and have to move on to other stuff.  If someone wants to 
forward me a clue feel free.

Now that I've got all of Chris' sequence stuff I discovered that 
my sequences are ... cluttered.

That's easy. Divorce didn't happen. The church and the society looked
after that. Only relatively recently that privilege was granted to kings, 
and only very recently to commoners.

1) I'm seeing lack of innovation, and -- more disturbing -- trend towards
even less innovation by an autocatalytic process (gerontocracy favors
gerontocracy).

My point was that the west, US first and foremost, importing innovation

import. While this kinda, sorta works on the short run, this is not
something sustainable.

ghtenment,"I finally let go of my Irix Magic desktop and window manager
and evaluated several other window managers. Having lost my 10 years
of customization with my X10 and then X11 desktop at one point
at UCI, I promised myself that I'd never get attached to
another WM.  I limped along in the default Gnome desktop, I
had a few unsuccessful stabs at the Solaris open view 
desktop, but nothing really stuck.   Because of this along
with SGI's love of pre-configured, pre-compiled freeware[1],
I never really made the jump from Irix to Linux either.  

After installing the enlightenment WM, I have to say, I am
really enlightened.  It's definitely a far cry from the no frills
first look from previous versions.  It's only on version 0.17,[2]
but it's a careful balance between simplicity, performance,
(fun) features, applications, and ease of customization.  The
number of themes they have on freshmeat is amazing. [3] After
less than an hour or two of ""nesting"" I already have almost
all my menus and controls setup just the way I want. 

I definitely recommend this to any Irix desktop holdouts.  It's
a great way to refresh your machine SGI without having to bite the
bullet and rebuild it as a Linux machine.

 If you think you can survive it, please fight... When I found that patent I
found others that were just common sense, things that any geek could implement
with his script/shell-language of choice; and it's time for someone to get the
medias attention on what's going on.
 Basically this is the new wave of ""namenappers""; it used to be domainnames,
not it's all the basic general ideas they can think off/find on the web that
they're patenting.

This may be a systematic bias in the testing procedure:  in real life, msgs
come ordered in time.  Say there's a thread that spans N messages on c.l.py.
In our testing setup, we'll train on a random sampling throughout its whole
lifetime, and test likewise.  New ham ""in the middle"" of this thread gets
benefit from that we trained on msgs that appeared both before and *after*
it in real life.  It's quite plausible that the f-p rate would rise without
this effect; in real life, at any given time some number of ham threads will
just be starting their lives, and if they're at all unusual the trained data
will know little to nothing about them.

MIME stands for ""Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions"".  It is the

Since MIME is only a few years old, there are still some mailers in use
which do not understand MIME messages.  However, there are a growing
number of mail programs that have MIME support built-in.  (One popular
MIME-capable mailer for Unix, VMS and PCs is Pine, developed at the
University of Washington and available via anonymous FTP from the host
ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file /pine/pine.tar.Z)

In addition, several proprietary email systems provide MIME translation
capability in their Internet gateway products.  However, even if you do
not have access to a MIME-capable mailer or suitable gateway, there is
still hope! 

There are a number of stand-alone programs that can interpret a MIME
message.  One of the more versatile is called ""munpack"".  It was developed
at Carnegie Mellon University and is available via anonymous FTP from the
host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pub/mpack/.  There are versions
available for Unix, PC, Mac and Amiga systems.  For compabibility with
older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also
decode messages in split-uuencoded format. 

Does MIME replace UUENCODE?

Yes.  UUENCODE has been used for some time for encoding binary files so
that they can be sent via Internet mail, but it has several technical
limitations and interoperability problems.  MIME uses a more robust
encoding called ""Base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the
message transformations made by certain email gateways. 

How can I learn more about MIME?

The MIME Internet standard is described in RFC-1521, available via
anonymous FTP from many different Internet hosts, including: 
                                                       
     o  US East Coast                            
        Address:  ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10)        
                                                        
     o  US West Coast                            
        Address:  ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32)      
                                                        
     o  Pacific Rim                              
        Address:  munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21)

  | I would encourage folks to play with those 10 lines of code in
  | Text_Selection and report what works well for them.  We may come up
  | with 8 lines that work for everyone, or perhaps introduce yet another
  | setting that lets folks choose between a few useful models.  Of course,
  | that's an admission of policy failure, but I'm willing to do that.

I actually think you're looking in the wrong place.   I, at least,
have almost no problems with the choice of what gets pasted, or
selected, that stuff (for me, if perhaps not users of some gnome variant,
which appraently has been fixed anyway) all seems to work just fine.

The problem is that a button 1 click clears the selection (PRIMARY)
where it shouldn't - the previous selection should only be cleared
when there's something else to replace it (even if the highlighting
of what is selected is removed).     Try this in any other ramdom
application (from xterm to netscape) and see how it works.  There
normally is *no* (mouse based) way to actually clear the primary
selection (that is, set it to be a null string).

Then, because of the ""if I get asked for the selection value, I will
find something"" behaviour, if you click (intending to set the insert
point, the way most other GUI's operate), and then paste, because the
PRIMARY is clear, but exmh still owns the selection, because nothing
else has taken it, it does and finds some other ramdom stuff, from
either the clipboard or cut buffer, which tends to be something that was
deleted back in the ancient past, and pastes that.

That behaviour, to me anyway, is the real issue.

Once that gets fixed, we can switch back to operating the normal
""select stuff, click at new insert point, paste"" mode of operation
that almost everyone expects to work (whether the ""select stuff""
is somewhere in one of the exmh windows, or elsewhere).

kre

ps: this message is from my experience as a exmh user only, I've never
really understood enough about X and selections to go gazing at that
part of the code and see how it all really operates.

Brothel duty for Australian MP

A conservative Member of Parliament in Australia is set to 
spend the day as a ""slave"" at one of Western Australia's most 
notorious brothels. 

Liberal Party member Barry Haase was ""won"" in a charity auction 
after the madam of Langtree's brothel in the mining town of 
Kalgoorlie made the highest offer for his services for a day. 

[...]

""I hope he will leave with an informed decision on what 
Australian brothels are all about and it will help him in his 
political career to make informed decisions that he might not 
have been able to make before,"" Ms Kenworthy said. 

Mr Haase, a member of Prime Minister John Howard's party 
seemed relaxed about the prospect of working in a brothel. 

""You can't be half-hearted about fundraising for significant 
charities and I think I'm big enough to play the game,"" he said.

=== Scissors === 

I, like most other people here, went through the security checkpoint. Unlike 
everyone else, they decided to search my suitcase. The security lady asked for 
permission and then took everything out: clothing, umbrellas, a jacket, and a 
box of crackers. She searched all the pockets: nothing. Apparently the jacket 
was suspicious; She sent it through again. Nothing. 

    The lady in the next lane waved a 10-inch knife and asked the lady in my 
    lane if it could go on. I can only assume she answered yes. 

She put everything back in and sent it through again. Still suspicious. They 
took everything out. It looked like this was going to take a while, so I used 
the opportunity to put the tickets I was holding back in my bag. When I looked 
back up, the security woman was brandishing a scissors and saying ""This can't 
go on board."" ""I don't remember packing that,"" I said. I let her confiscate it. 

I called my Mom. She doesn't remember packing it either. Is there some sort of 
terrorist plot to plant scissors in innocent-looking people's suitcases? I 
can't see why this would be useful. How would they know what plane I'm on? Once 
I'm on the plane how would they get the scissors? They could threaten me, but 
if they have a threatening implement already, then why do they need the 
scissors? Perhaps it's some sort of Matroishca-doll system. They use their 
fists to get the infant to give them the squeaky mouse, they use the squeaky 
mouse to scare the toddler into giving them a copy of _A New Kind of Science_, 
they use ANKS to bludgeon a 5th Grader into giving them a wedge block, and they 
use the wedge to get me to give them the scissors. Those are some pretty clever 
terrorists. 

*Update:* False alarm. My Mom called. Apparently it was the scissors she was 
using to cut loose threads from my tie last night. It must have fallen in. The 
nation can go back to Yellow Level Terrorist Alert.  

=== Waiting for Wireless === 

Now I am at O'Hare Airport, sitting outside the Admiral's Club while 
businessmen walk in and out. I am looking for a wireless signal, the signal I 
used last time I was here, but not finding it. Of course, last time I was here, 
I had an Admiral's Club card. This time I have a Mileage Plus Card, but despite 
the airline ologopoly--or perhaps because of it (have to keep up appearances, 
you know)--I doubt they will accept it. 

=== Irony === 

According to the announcement I just heard, Mr. Valenti is going to miss his 
flight. 

I think of what I'd say if I ran into him. ""Jack!"" I'd exclaim, as if we were 
old pals. ""Going to the Eldred case?"" Of course he was. ""Going to be a good 
one."" ""Hey, remember when you had that debate with Lessig?"" I'd ask. ""You said 
you were starting a new task force to make movies legitimately available on the 
Internet. What ever happened to that?"" I imagine him mumbling and looking down 
at his watch. His plane is going to leave soon; he has to run. 

Another announcement: Mr. Michael McKenna needs to call his office. Good thing 
these airline announcements keep me up to date. 

=== Automatic Flush Toilets === 

Now I am short and the sensing system was mounted up tall in both instances. In 
the first, at my old high school (where you think some people might be a little 
short...), the flush went off once accidentally. OK, I thought, I can handle 
one mistake. Then it went off again. Here at the airport, it misfired three 
times. 

This is annoying and inexcusable. Have they not heard of user testing? Do they 
expect only tall people to use these bathrooms? This problem must be remedied 
immediately. I recommend releasing a Service Pack on the manufacturer's web 
site. 

=== Arrival === 

I've arrived in D.C.--once again, I'm sitting a block away from my hotel on the 
sidewalk borrowing someone's connection. Trip was very smooth, had lunch with 
Lisa and went to the Spy Museum (pretty cool, but could have been better). Now 
for the meetings and parties. 

Sorry for not responding to your email. I'm rather busy. ;-)

Here's a fix that I think will make a real difference.

Ftoc_ShowSequences needs to be able to be called with an optional list of msgids 
to update and if it's called that way it only removes or adds tags for those 
messages.  Then in places like MsgChange, we only update the messages which have
changed.

Also, a separate Ftoc_ShowSequence function which only updates the display of 
one sequence should be written which also takes an optional list of msgids.  
In a place like MsgChange, it would only need to update the cur sequence.

If nobody else gets to it, I'll do this when I get back.

I gave it all the thought it deserved <wink>.  It would be wonderful to get
several people cranking on the same test data, and I'm all in favor of that.
OTOH, my Data/ subtree currently has more than 35,000 files slobbering over
134 million bytes -- even if I had a place to put that much stuff, I'm not
sure my ISP would let me email it in one msg <wink>.

Apart from that, there was a mistake very early on whose outcome was that
this isn't the data I hoped I was using.  I *hoped* I was using a snapshot
of only recent msgs (to match the snapshot this way of only spam from 2002),
but turns out they actually go back to the last millennium.  Greg Ward is
currently capturing a stream coming into python.org, and I hope we can get a
more modern, and cleaner, test set out of that.  But if that stream contains
any private email, it may not be ethically possible to make that available.
Can you think of anyplace to get a large, shareable ham sample apart from a

Let me get this straight; a registry key is loaded from the server onto 
the client workstations who can modify it, then write it back onto the 
server's own registry - which is not going to use it?

What is the reason to write a registry key to a server if the server 
itself is not using it?
I don't think you should worry too much about someone travelling out of 
the hive, but again, I'm curious as to how the driver actually modifies 
the keys on the server.

And if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide 
open for something nasty here.
Two other things spring to mind; 
1) If anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are 
not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects.
2) If anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can 
create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the 
registry. The result of such a thing is obvious.

If I got this all wrong, I'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell 
me where I might have misunderstood.

dies as whale lands on boat,"
Forwarded-by: Sven Guckes <guckes@math.fu-berlin.de>

Port San Luis, California
September 05, 2002

A WHALE which suddenly breached and crashed into the bow of a
fishing boat killed a restaurant owner on board.

Jerry Tibbs, 51, of Bakersfield, California, was aboard his boat,
The BBQ, when the whale hit and tossed him into the sea five miles
off Port San Luis.

Three other fishermen stayed aboard the damaged boat, which was
towed to shore by the US Coast Guard.

Tibbs and his three friends were just ending a day fishing for
albacore when the accident occurred, authorities said.

Tibbs' body was found after a search lasting more than 18 hours
Coast Guard officials said it was the first time they could recall
an accident caused by a whale hitting a boat.

I have used these commands to explore ALSA and my chip:

arecord -l   (list devices)
arecord -L   (list PCM decices)

I get some output like this:

I left a big hint there in the way the blogChannel module[3] is designed, 
patterned after the Syndication module[4] designed by the RDF folk. In other 
words, the place where they're expressing discomfort with RSS 2.0 is where they 
can make it their own. Lead. Instead of feeling disempowered, be powerful.  

At one point I saw clearly where the compromise between RSS 0.9x and 1.0 was. 
We could have gotten there in early 2001, so instead we get there in late 2002. 
So what, not a big deal. Think about how much better it will be _when we're all 
advocating the same format._ Visualize peace. That's basically what I did when 
I did the 2.0 spec. I know it's hard to swallow, but swallow anyway. If I did 
it, you can too.

My problem is not the same as MS's one, I don't have to deal with millions of 
identical copy of the same CD with propably millions of working keys.  Each 
download can be unique with a small preparation delay.  The key generator is 
a problem only if multiple keys are usable.  If the end users are teenagers, 
you'll face a huge wall when asking to be 100% of the time online but if we 
think of something like a health care system that keep track of patients 
personnal information, the end user will be willing to take every possible 
steps to protect the system from his own employees to use illegaly.

I agree with all of you that mass production CDs will not be safe from piracy 
in a near futur.  That can be seen as a collateral of mass market 
penetration.

BTW thanks for all of you who provided interestiong insight.  I'm playing with 
gdb's dissassembler now but I don't think it's what a typical cracker would 
use.  Any hints on UNIX cracking tools ?

Anything equivalent will be spam, just not email spam.  Dump entry IPs for

Vast Detail on Towers' Collapse May Be Sealed

September 30, 2002
By JAMES GLANZ and ERIC LIPTON 




 

What is almost certainly the most sophisticated and
complete understanding of exactly how and why the twin
towers of the World Trade Center fell has been compiled as
part of a largely secret proceeding in federal court in
Lower Manhattan. 

Amassed during the initial stages of a complicated
insurance lawsuit involving the trade center, the
confidential material contains data and expert analysis
developed by some of the nation's most respected
engineering minds. It includes computer calculations that
have produced a series of three-dimensional images of the
crumpled insides of the towers after the planes hit,
helping to identify the sequence of failures that led to
the collapses. 

An immense body of documentary evidence, like maps of the
debris piles, rare photos and videos, has also been
accumulated in a collection that far outstrips what
government analysts have been able to put together as they
struggle to answer the scientifically complex and
emotionally charged questions surrounding the deadly
failures of the buildings. 

But everyone from structural engineers to relatives of
victims fear that the closely held information, which
includes the analysis and the possible answers that
families and engineers around the world have craved, may
remain buried in sealed files, or even destroyed. 

Bound by confidentiality agreements with their clients, the
experts cannot disclose their findings publicly as they
wait for the case to play out. Such restrictions are
typical during the discovery phase of litigation. And as it
now stands, the judge in the case - who has agreed that
certain material can remain secret for the time being - has
approved standard legal arrangements that, should the
lawsuit be settled before trial, could cause crucial
material generated by the competing sides to be withheld. 

""We're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but
we can't until we're told what to do,"" said Matthys Levy,
an engineer and founding partner at Weidlinger Associates,
who is a consultant in the case and the author of ""Why
Buildings Fall Down: How Structures Fail"" (Norton, 2nd
edition, 2002). 

""Let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole
process"" of the collapse, Mr. Levy said. 

Monica Gabrielle, who lost her husband, Richard, when the
south tower fell and who is a member of the Skyscraper
Safety Campaign, said the information should be disclosed.
""If they have answers and are not going to share them, I
would be devastated,"" Mrs. Gabrielle said. ""They have a
moral obligation."" 

The lawsuit that has generated the information involves
Larry A. Silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the
trade center property, and a consortium of insurance
companies. Mr. Silverstein maintains that each jetliner
that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist
attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half
that amount, as the insurance companies say. 

As both sides have prepared their arguments, they have
spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert
opinion about exactly what happened to the towers. 

Dean Davison, a spokesman for Industrial Risk Insurers of
Hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said
of the findings, ""There are some confidentiality agreements
that are keeping those out of the public domain today."" He
conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20
insurers on his side of the case could complicate any
release of the material. 

As for his own company, whose consultants alone have
produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of
diagrams and photographs, Mr. Davison said every attempt
would be made to give the material eventually to ""public
authorities and investigative teams."" 

Still, some of that analysis relies on information like
blueprints and building records from other sources, like
the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which built
and owned the trade center and supports Mr. Silverstein in
the suit. Mr. Davison said he was uncertain how the
differing origins of the material would influence his
company's ability to release information. 

In a statement, the Port Authority said access to documents
would be ""decided on a case-by-case basis consistent with
applicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperate
with ""federal investigations."" 

The fate of the research is particularly critical to
resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell,
given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into
the buildings' collapse. That investigation, led by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency, was plagued by few
resources, a lack of access to crucial information like
building plans, and infighting among experts and officials.
A new federal investigation intended to remedy those
failings has just begun at the National Institute of
Standards and Technology, or NIST, an agency that has
studied many building disasters. 

Officials with NIST have said it could take years to make
final determinations and recommendations for other
buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded
up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on
the lawsuit. 

Gerald McKelvey, a spokesman for Mr. Silverstein, said of
the real estate executive's own heavily financed
investigative work, ""We decline to comment other than to
say that Silverstein is cooperating fully with the NIST
investigation."" A spokesman for the agency confirmed it was
in discussions with Mr. Silverstein on the material, but
said no transfer had taken place. 

With no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by
both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body
of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the
trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. 

""The work should be available to other investigators,"" said
Ramon Gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner
at Gilsanz Murray Steficek, who was a member of the earlier
inquiry. ""It could be used to build better buildings in the
future."" 

Legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one
governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes,
from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such
information. In some cases, litigants who paid for the
reports may make them public themselves. Or they may ask to
have them sealed forever. 
""It is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep
some of those documents secret for one reason or another,
some legitimate, some not,"" said Lee Levine, a First
Amendment lawyer at Levine Sullivan & Koch in Washington. 

Mr. Levine said that because of the presumed value of the
information, the court might look favorably on requests to
make it public. But the uncertainty over the fate of the
material is unnerving to many people, especially experts
who believe that only a complete review of the evidence -
not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect
their own interests - could lead to an advance in the
federal investigation of the trade center. 

""It's important for this to get presented and published and
subjected to some scrutiny,"" said Dr. John Osteraas,
director of civil engineering practice at Exponent Failure
Analysis in Menlo Park, Calif., and a consultant on the
case, ""because then the general engineering community can
sort it out."" 

The scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by
any measure. Mr. Levy and his colleagues at Weidlinger
Associates, hired by Silverstein Properties, have called
upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with
the Pentagon for classified research, to create a model of
the Sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. 

The result is a compilation of three-dimensional images of
the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged
core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and
proceeding up to the moments of collapse. Those images -
which Mr. Levy is not allowed to release - have helped
pinpoint the structural failures. 

The FEMA investigators did not have access to such computer
modeling. Nor did the FEMA team have unfettered access to
the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks
immediately after the attacks. But no such constraints
hampered engineers at LZA/Thornton-Tomasetti, brought to
the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of
Sept. 11. Daniel A. Cuoco, the company president and a
consultant to Silverstein Properties on the case, said he
had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground
zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how
the towers fell. 

Though the FEMA team could not determine ""where things
actually fell,"" Mr. Cuoco said, ""we've indicated the
specific locations."" 

Mr. Cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details
of the findings. Nor would Mr. Osteraas discuss the details
of computer calculations his company has done on the spread
of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. Mr.
Osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of
photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of
which he believes have not been available to other
investigators. 

And the investigation has not limited itself to computers
and documentary evidence. For months, experiments in wind
tunnels in the United States and Canada have been examining
the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed
the weakening structures. 

Jack Cermak, president of Cermak Peterka Peterson in Fort
Collins, Colo., was retained by the insurance companies but
had previously performed wind-tunnel studies for the
original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. For
the legal case, Dr. Cermak said, ""we've done probably more
detailed measurements than in the original design."" 

""The data that have been acquired are very valuable in
themselves for understanding how wind and buildings
interact,"" Dr. Cermak said. ""Some of the information may be
valuable for the litigation,"" he said, adding, ""I think
I've told you all I can.""

This step is unneccesary -- unless you've changed the scripts 
much, any test in the logs which aren't in the rules files will 
just be ignored I think.  You do seem to have changed the 
logs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify 
immutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the 
code and couldn't fully make out how it had changed.  I think we 
want to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there 
somewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff?  For 
the last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently 
(by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have 
immutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.

] Klez: The Virus That  Won't Die,"Klez: The Virus That Won't Die
 
Already the most prolific virus ever, Klez continues to wreak havoc.

Andrew Brandt
>>From the September 2002 issue of PC World magazine
Posted Thursday, August 01, 2002


The Klez worm is approaching its seventh month of wriggling across 
the Web, making it one of the most persistent viruses ever. And 
experts warn that it may be a harbinger of new viruses that use a 
combination of pernicious approaches to go from PC to PC.

Antivirus software makers Symantec and McAfee both report more than 
2000 new infections daily, with no sign of letup at press time. The 
British security firm MessageLabs estimates that 1 in every 300 
e-mail messages holds a variation of the Klez virus, and says that 
Klez has already surpassed last summer's SirCam as the most prolific 
virus ever.

And some newer Klez variants aren't merely nuisances--they can carry 
other viruses in them that corrupt your data.

So how much of it is due to jumping the inter-species boundary for

The alternative hypothesis is that its due to novelty, and then of

G] connecting at 1200bps in RH7.3 (help!),"Hi All,

Anyone ever try connecting at 1200bps in Linux? I've got a USR 56K
Faxmodem which is meant to connect to another (same) modem and I have to
connect at this speed due to the (NT) port settings on the remote side,
but the modem handshake always fails at this speed.

The modem handshake works at slightly higher speeds (4800bps to
~57600bps) but that is no good for tx/rx'ing data to the remote server
as it insists at talking at the speed of treacle/1200bps.

Note Minicom fails to handshake at 1200bps, but HyperTerm in Windows
worked first time(!?), any ideas?

Baud 1200 7 data bits Even Parity

I am doing a ATZ3 to reset the modem then I send this init string:

AT&F1E1V1Q0X4Y0S32=232&A1&B0&C1&D2&H0&I0&K1&M4&N0&P0&R1&S0&U0&Y1

... which is most of the defaults.

USR said to set S15=128 (disables v.42)) 
& set S32=98 (disable v.92 & X2)

But the S15=128 just makes the handshake lockup instead of just giving
up.

btw this is a bank's system I am connecting to so reconfiguring their
modems may be difficult.

This is a standard trap for people building things from source. It's
generally wise to have a special ""build"" environment to avoid these
hassles. Most likely you have some library loading path in your env. An
strace of the app will show it:

	the-app 2>&1 | grep dude

Personally, I have a script called logbuild whose entire purpose is to
start a shell with a minimal build environment, logged with script. The
prevents this kind of error. Since configure yanks all sorts of ill
documented values from one's environment for use in the build (CC, ARCH,
various LD_* variables) this kind of thing is necessary.

Often the easiest thing is to have a special nonroot account with no .profile
for building stuff.

Or if you can, I couldn't find it before deleting myself, and now it's
invisible to me.  Another interesting thing: Security forms are reset
to full-public settings each time you load them, rather than set from
your current settings.

All in all, I wasn't impressed and have stayed with the Yahooligans

IMO spamtrap data that's well-cleaned and monitored is fine.

To my mind there's 3 types of spamtraps:

  1. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps when the user closes
    the account

  2. old user addresses, recycled into spamtraps several months after the
    user closes the account, scanned for newsletters, unsubscribed
    from them etc.

  3. real spamtrap addresses to trap website crawlers.

The latter 2 are the most effective, but #1 is a real PITA; it takes lots
of maintainance to avoid ham getting in there.  Some of my spamtrap data
had a few 1's contributed by ISPs, and I hadn't spent enough time sifting
for legit mail that was slipping through.  So I felt better leaving
them out for this run, apart from what I'd hand-cleaned.

Wanting to sort like that is not common; I'd be surprised if exmh has

mh tools, though.
I suggest doing the following from a shell prompt:

 sh -c 'for f in ""`folders -recurse -fast`"" ; do sortm +""$f"" ; done'

(The command ""sortm"" will sort a particular folder, and
""folders -recurse -fast"" prints out a list of all of your folders.)

Yes, but that probably means that you have to have exmh
running on the laptop to get the notification?
With exmh getting upset by two instances running at the
same time, this creates the problem that I cannot  run to the

Cool, one less package to maintain :)

One interesting thing about alsaplayer is that RedHat's XMMS package in RH8 will
probably not play mp3 files. But alsaplayer does play mp3s ""out of the box"".

Also, they are developing rapidly in their CVS and looks like their next version
of alsaplaer will be pretty cool, but I have no idea when it will be ready.

http://www.thisislocallondon.co.uk/news/weird/display.var.633939.Bizarre+London.0.html


Security cameras at the Gardiner house filmed the cat
The Plumstead panther has been spotted just yards from the scene of a 
sighting made three weeks ago but this time it was caught on camera.

Steve Gardiner, 41, claims to have spotted the large cat in his garden in 
Upton Road, Plumstead, in the sixth reported sighting in Woolwich and Bexley 
in just four weeks.

Mr Gardiner told News Shopper he watched the big cat as it walked alongside 
the house at about 7.15am, on Wednesday, September 25, while his security 
cameras captured it on film.

The father-of-four described the black cat as about 3ft long and 
two-and-a-half-foot high, with a large body.

He said: ""It prowled past the patio doors moving with all the mannerisms of 
a hunter.

""It looked at me calmly before moving on.""

The bricklayer told how his work colleagues let him know News Shopper had 
been following the big cat story so he decided to call our offices with news 
of the sighting.

His wife, Karen, 41, later checked the tape which had captured grainy images 
of the large cat prowling through their garden.

She said: ""I feel sorry for it not living in its natural habitat I'd hate 
for it to get hurt.""

Mr Gardiner told how he is convinced of the cat's existence saying how their 
usually quiet 18-year-old dog barks at ""nothing"" in the garden but barked 
that morning.

He warned: ""I don't think these cats are dangerous but, if cornered, they 
might jump you.""

Sightings of the large black cat are being reported all over the Plumstead 
Common and Shooters Hill as well at the Bexley area.

If you have seen the big cat, call News Shopper on 01689 885712.

Indeedy - I had never even heard of firebird until we started a new job
last week with a client who uses it.  So we popped it onto a box
downstairs and wow - it is fast.  Comes with some lovely client tools
also.  Supports all the db goodies, transactions, stored procedures,
triggers.

IBM's db2 is another cheaper alternative to Oracle.  Free single

Encryption approach to secure web applications,"Hi,

Thank you for the useful replies, I have found some interesting 
tutorials in the ibm developer connection.

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec1

and

https://www6.software.ibm.com/developerworks/education/j-sec2

Registration is needed.

I will post the same message on the Web Application Security list, as 
suggested by someone.

For now, I thing I will use md5 for password checking (I will use the 
approach described in secure programmin fo linux and unix how-to).

I will separate the authentication module, so I can change its 
implementation at anytime.

Thank you again!

*Political spam on your cell phone?*
By Lisa M. Bowman <mailto:lisa.bowman@cnet.com>

*In a decision that treats text messaging on mobile phones essentially 
the same as bumper stickers, the Federal Election Commission has 
declared that senders of text-based political ads don't have to disclose 
who funded them.*

In an advisory opinion issued Thursday, the FEC also suggested such 
messages include either a phone number or Web site link, so people could 
easily learn who paid for the message. However, the additional 
information won't be required.

The opinion could encourage the adoption of text-based political ads, as 
campaign experts look for new technological ways to sway voters. At the 
same time, opponents of the plan fear it could lead to anonymous 
political spam.

Target Wireless, a small New Jersey-based wireless media company, had 
asked the FEC for an opinion on the matter, saying that requiring 
financial disclosures on short messaging service (SMS) mailings would 
use up too much of the 160 character-maximum.

Political messages on bumper stickers and buttons are also exempt from 
the financial disclosure requirement. Target Wireless' petition was 
supported by the National Republican Senatorial Committee, the Cellular 
Telecommunications and Internet Association, and some advertising trade 
groups.

FEC spokesman Bob Biersack said the opinion was in keeping with the 
commission's policy not to meddle with new technology that has the 
potential to reach more voters.

""We have tried very hard not to get in the way--particularly before 
everyone understands how the technology is going to work,"" he said.

Opponents of the plan have worried the exemption might encourage spam or 
allow senders to blast people with mass amounts of negative political 
messages while remaining anonymous.

Biersack said the FEC can revisit the issue if those problems surface.

Target Wireless President Craig Krueger characterized the opinion as 
""good for America.""

""It will allow people to receive more communication from those running 
for office,"" he said. ""We have free speech on our side.""

The new spec didn't even want to build the package
something with config.mak
Also this new spec looks like the old one, it got libdv and libdv-devel
in the BuildRequires so I just used the normal spec and removed it manully.

It looks like you're running via procmail -- what are the permissions
on procmail?  ""Insecure dependency"" screams ""I'm in taint mode!"", which
is a typical problem when procmail is setuid/setgid (the permissions
should be 755).

If this is in fact the problem, an easy solution is to put ""DROPPRIVS=3Dyes""
in the procmailrc. :)

Hello,

I have just spoken with an UUnet technician at 11:23 PDT and he was unable
to provide me with any new information regarding the outage.  He did
confirm that problems had spread beyond the east coast and are now seen
nationwide through out their network.  They are currently working with
their hardware vendor to try and isolate the issue.

A large number of Internap's connections to UUnet remain shutdown and
traffic is being routed over alternate providers.  The scale of this
outage is causing a large number of peering points with UUnet and other
providers to be flooded due to the large traffic shifts.

If you have problems reaching specific sites please send an email to
noc@internap.com containing a traceroute and source/destination IP
addresses and we will investigate.  If it is possible will will attempt to
move specific prefixes onto an alternate provider leaving an Internap PNAP
if that will provide better performance.

Regards,
Andrew

UUnet is currently experiencing a large number of problems in their North
American backbone.  Internap has been aware of these problems since approx
06:00 PST.  Most of the problems appear to be concentrated on the East
Coast but we have reports of problems from other geographic regions.

This is being tracked under Internap ticket 106448 and UUnet master ticket
651751.

UUnet currently does not have any ETA for a fix for this event.

If you have issues reaching a specific site please send an email to
noc@internap.com with a traceroute showing the path which has a problem.

Internap has shutdown peerings to UUnet is various cities to help reduce
the number of problems that customers will experience.

According to some old documentation (man exmh-ref)

     The mouse bindings for the folders labels are:

          Left - Change to folder.
          Middle - View nested folders.
          Right - Refile current messages to the folder.
          Shift-Right - Link current messages to the folder.
          Shift-Middle - Drag a folder label to some drop target.
          Control-Right - Clear the current target folder.

It should be possible to link using shift-right-click the same way you 
can move using only right-click.

Woah ;) did you tweak some flags yourself, like default rpm flags ? What 
dist are you running ? I don't think there's an athalon-redhat-linux 
machine as standard ;) it should be some permutation of athlon and linux, 
and without redhat, but I can't tell for sure.   Any idea where your

"mentum Acquires E-Room, Melding Content, Collaboration","
Don't know much about eRoom - but there is the magic phrase 'collaborate in
real-time'... Groove really has people running scared. Wonder if any users
actually /benefit/ from collaborating in real-time.


===
http://www.internetwk.com/breakingNews/INW20021004S0001

Content-management vendor Documentum said late Thursday it plans to acquire
privately held e-Room Technologies in a deal worth about $100 million.

Documentum will issue approximately 7.7 million shares of its common stock
and pay about $12.6 million in cash for all of the outstanding shares of
eRoom.

Documentum makes a platform for enterprise-wide content management. ERoom
makes tools for enterprise collaboration. Its customers include Airbus,
Bausch & Lomb, Ford Motor Co., and Sony.

Documentum announced plans this summer to deliver a new Collaboration
Edition of its content-management suite. ERoom was already integrating its
tools to the Documentum platform, making an acquisition an easy target,
according to Documentum president and CEO Dave DeWalt.

With the upcoming joint product, customers will be able to collaborate in
real-time via virtual workspaces, sharing schedules, resources, and even
jointly creating content.

Content creation and management has always been a collaborative task, but
workflow has usually been delivered via a Web browser interface or even
simple e-mail -- and rarely in real-time.

For now, Documentum will sell the eRoom platform and its own
content-management system through combined sales channels. Further
integration is planned down the line, the companies said.

Don't run SA on mails this large. Most people tend to ignore mails 
larger than about 250K in spamassassin processing, because it just kills 
performance. There are some known issues with the parsing (such as the 
HTML parsing stuff which is much improved in 2.40 which we're soon to 
release), but nothing that's too likely to be fixed by 2.40. Perhaps in 
2.50 though.

zteana] Frog Fall at Cheapside,"Near the end of his *Memoirs of Extraordinary Popular Delusions and the
Madness of Crowds* (1851), Charles Mackay discusses various catch phrases
briefly popular in mid-19th-century London. One of them, he observes,
""like a mushroom, seems to have sprung up in the night, or, like a frog in
Cheapside, to have come down in a sudden shower. One day it was unheard,
unknown, uninvented; the next it pervaded London.""

Was ""like a frog in Cheapside"" (or something similar) a catch phrase
itself, or did Mackay come up with the simile on his own?

And to what event or events does it refer?

I didn't find anything relevant in Partridge's *A Dictionary of Catch
Phrases.*

Well I dont have to worry about microwavers in the house. Ours died a week
or so ago and due to doing some research we will nto be getting anysuch
device in the near or far future. I mean even if one half of the crap it
is reported to do is true it s just not worth it for a quick cup or warm
chai.

Which brings me to the fact that finding a good Convection only (not combo
with a microwaver) oven of any good size is dang near impossible unless
you go up to the bizness sizes. thankfully there is Dehlongi of which
costco has thru thier online store.

Now of course the question is do we get it delivered to the old house or
the new one (yep we got our offer approved and are in the short run down
to a long mortage:)  we close on oct 31. though the realestate agent says
t happens like that a lot, I still find it incrediably jolting to have
found a house inthe hood I want with the space dawn wants on sunday and we
are signing papers on tuesday night with a close at the end of the month.

Which of course means....wifi land for wsmf:)- )

So far I like the Linksys dsl/cable router all in one wifi ap. The Dlink
has the funky 22mb stuff IF you use all thier stuff across the net and the
way things go I cant say thats gonna happen for sure. Pluse the Linksys
stuff is all over the mass market sotres so I cna walk home with parts at
any time.

The fun now comes with a realization that with ATTbi cable as my main hose
tot he net offering up bwf might be a tad problematic....So i am thinking
of ways around/through/under that. the setup of the particualrs are far
form set in stone...any ideas would be welcome.

Also any portlanders.....party time.

So thought I, but apparently all it favours is a lot of whining about good

Please help a newbie compile mplayer :-),"Make sure you rebuild as root and you're in the directory that you
downloaded the file.  Also it might complain of a few dependencies but
you can get these at freshrpms.net, except for gcc3, which you can find
on your Red Hat cd, Red Hat ftp, or rpmfind.net.

After you rebuild the source rpm it should install a binary rpm in
/usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386.  With all dependencies met, install mplayer
with 'rpm -ivh mplayer-20020106-fr1.rpm' and you should be good to go.

One last thing, you will need the win32 codecs, I found them on google,
create a directory /usr/lib/win32 and place the codecs in there.

Good Luck!

I actually thought of this kind of active chat at AOL (in 1996 I think), 
bringing up ads based on what was being discussed and other features. 
For a while, the VP of dev. (now still CTO I think) was really hot on 
the idea and they discussed patenting it. Then they lost interest.

Tech's Major Decline
College Students Turning Away From Bits and Bytes

By Ellen McCarthy
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, August 27, 2002; Page E01

If John Yandziak had been entering college a few years ago, he might have
sought a stake in the ""new"" economy. He might have dreamed of becoming an
ace code-cracker for the CIA or the National Security Agency, or imagined
toppling an empire with revolutionary software. Maybe he would have tried to
use the Internet to end world hunger.

But as Yandziak attends his first college classes this week, he's harboring
different academic ambitions. The Ashburn native says he wants to do
something more social and more interesting than working with computers.

Besides, he said while packing for a Charlottesville dormitory room, ""you
can't get the chicks with that anymore.""

The tech industry's financial problems are enough to bankrupt the dreams of
some fair-weather students. But now there's another consequence of the tech
bust: Enrollment growth in undergraduate computer science departments has
come to a halt.

The number of undergraduates majoring in computer science fell 1 percent in
2001, according to a report by the Computing Research Association. And
educators in the field say the trend seems to be accelerating, with some
colleges seeing much greater drops as the new academic year begins.

The word is out among department deans that the bust's fallout has trickled
into the classroom, said Maria Clavez, president of the Association of
Computing Machinery.

""I've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic
declines,"" said Clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering
at Princeton University in January. ""It can be hard to see this, because at
some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far
exceeds the available space. [But] it is going to have an effect.""

At Virginia Tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science
department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. At George Washington
University, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer
science fell by more than half this year.

Interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the
past decade. In 1997, schools with PhD programs in computer science and
computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the Computing
Research Association. The numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees
were awarded.

The Labor Department projects that software engineering will be the
fastest-growing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other
computer-related industries trailing close behind.

But in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among
college students. For example, 900 of the 2,000-plus undergraduates studying
information technology and engineering at George Mason University were
computer science majors last year. This year the enrollment in that major is
down to 800, although a newly created and more general information
technology major has attracted 200 students.

""Having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said Lloyd Griffith,
dean of George Mason's information technology and engineering school.
""Particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four
years on something and then not get a job.""

Freshman enrollment for the University of Maryland's computer science major
is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. Maryland
decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does
not account for the drop, said Steve Halperin, dean of Maryland's College of
Computer, Mathematical and Physical Sciences.

""We are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their
interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" Halperin said. ""That's a
factual statement. But I would say that at this point . . . we don't expect
to see a decrease in the number of graduates. Many of the kids who are no
longer expressing an interest in majoring in CS would have fallen off.""

Yandziak, who began at the University of Virginia on Saturday, is not
convinced that's the case. He graduated in the top 5 percent of his class,
with a 3.9 grade-point average, and nailed the highest possible score on his
advanced-placement exam in computer science.

""All of my classes have been easy for me. Math and sciences were always fun,
so I looked for professions in which I could use those things,"" Yandziak
said. ""I'm just not sure I want my life to be immersed in [technology]. I
want to do something that will contribute to the practical world.""

Harris N. Miller, president of the Information Technology Association of
America, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals,
salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage.

""There was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s; potentially you have the
same sort of thing going on right now. People are saying, 'I don't need this
kind of IT training right now,' "" Miller said. ""Our concern as an industry
is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the
road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to
find themselves in a shortage situation.""

Economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other
factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social
influences, also come into play, said Judy Hingle, director of professional
development at the American College Counseling Association. The perception
of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in
the industry have tried to squelch. That stereotype went underground during
the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust.

""All the hipness is gone,"" Yandziak said. ""Once we thought of the Internet
as this thing with infinite capabilities. It was basically just a fad that
came along.""

Lamont Thompson, a recent graduate of Calvin Coolidge Senior High School in
the District, is headed to Morehouse College in Atlanta to study business
marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development.

""Technology comes natural to people my age; it's not fascinating anymore,""
Thompson said. ""To be honest with you, when I think computer science, I
think of some guy sitting behind a computer all day in a dark room. It's a
necessity, but I wouldn't take it any further.""

That may not be true, but it would put things in a more interesting

trying to starve them.

It sounded consistent with the ideas and purpose of the train full of
activists.

I'm rarely an apologist for Muslims anywhere.  Yet I find my sympathies
with the Muslims in this case, even after they burned the train.

[Razor-users] Using razor with maildrop,"

I use both.  SpamAssassin (SA) catches things that Razor does not.  There
were enough false positives with Razor that I do not trust it alone.
After whitelisting all the newsletters I receive, SA w/ Razor2 does a

e: Heinous DVD Pirates,"URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000644
Date: 2002-10-08T01:21:33-06:00

DeCSS detractors have repeatedly claimed that DeCSS needs to be stopped because 
it makes perfect digital copies of DVDs possible. Recently, in private email, 
Ernest Miller claimed that doing so would be a violation of the DMCA. In this 
in-depth special report, I show that using perfectly legal, (I assume) 
licensed, off-the-shelf consumer software, copying DVDs is easy and in many 
ways encouraged. 

*Tools:*
1 PowerBook G4 with slot-loading DVD drive (any model should work)
1 Monsters, Inc. Collector's Edition DVD (any DVD should work)
1 copy of Mac OS X 10.2 ""Jaguar"" 

*Process:*
1. Insert DVD into drive. Notice how Jaguar helpfully loads the DVD Player for 
you.
2. Open the DVD (it appears on the desktop) and drag the VIDEO_TS folder to 
your hard drive. Ejct the DVD.
3. In DVD Player, select ""Open VIDEO_TS Folder..."" from the File menu. Use the 
dialog that appears to select the VIDEO_TS folder on your hard drive. 

Now the DVD plays just like it would were the DVD in the drive. By extension, I 
could also put the DVD up on my site for you to download and watch. I could 
share it via a P2P network. And I haven't done anything to decrypt the DVD or 
violate the DMCA: I've used only basic tools available to all normal computer 
users on my (I assume) fully-licensed consumer laptop. 

*Disclaimer:* Seth Schoen, whose opinion I highly respect on these matters, 
finds it unlikely that the DVD was CSS-encrypted if this was possible. I am not 
sure how to verify if the DVD is CSS-encrypted. If someone has a suggestion, 
please let me know. However, if it is true, then it's very interesting that 
Disney has released such a major movie without encryption.

I *meant* to say that they were 0.99 clues cancelled out by 0.01
clues.  But that's wrong too!  It looks I haven't grokked this part of
your code yet; this one has way more than 16 clues, and it seems the
classifier basically ended up counting way more 0.99 than 0.01 clues,
and no others made it into the list.  I thought it was looking for
clues with values in between; apparently it found none that weren't
exactly 0.5?

> That sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!

This happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few
similar ones.  I wonder if there's anything we can learn from looking
at the clues and the HTML.  It was heavily marked-up HTML, with ads in
the sidebar, but the body text was a serious discussion of ""OO and
soft coding"" with lots of highly technical words as clues (including
Zope and ZEO).

Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?
Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make
progress there?

No, sorry.  These were all of the following structure:

  multipart/mixed
      text/plain        (brief text plus URL(s))
      text/html         (long HTML copied from website)

I guess you get this when you click on ""mail this page"" in some

OK, noone has been tool-less for memory management for a LONG time. Most
systems you just add a flag and memory is tracked (that's how i've always
done it) or worst case yuo have to run it through one of the 2.3E7 tools
where you simply recompile and it it tells you where the leaks are.

Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any idea at all how the
hardware functions. Granted, this takes 30 minutes to go over, and so is far
beyond the scope of the ""Learn Java in 90 minutes without thinking"" book

I'm skeptical.  

One of the many perversions of modern civilization is the fictitious
rendering of various peoples, frequently to the point where the fiction
is more ""real"" than the reality.  You see it over and over again in
history:  The Primitive People pull a fast one on Whitey The Junior
Anthropologist, playing to all the prejudices of Whitey (who only became
Junior Anthropologists to support personal ideologies), and before you
know it the charade takes on a life of its own which the Primitive
People are compelled to perpetuate.  Worse, even when there is
substantial evidence to the contrary with some basic scholarship, the
facts have a hard time competing with the ideologically pleasing fiction
that is already firmly entrenched.  And many peoples (e.g. American
Indians) develop a profit motive for maintaining and promoting the myth
in popular culture.

I'm far more inclined to believe that people is people, no matter where
you are on the planet.  The only time you see any anomalies is when you
have a self-selecting sub-population within an otherwise normal
population, which is hardly a fair way to look at any major population.

There's a brief discussion of this before the definition of
MAX_DISCRIMINATORS.  All clues with prob MIN_SPAMPROB and MAX_SPAMPROB are
saved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap.
Then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of
clues in the longer list.  Whatever remains of the longer list (if anything)
is then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS of
them.  In no case do more than MAX_DISCRIMINATORS clues enter into the final
probability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list
of clues (else you'd have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring;
and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual
review is needed).  In your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer
MAX_SPAMPROB list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that's
why you didn't see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99.

Before adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and
0.99 clues was too often a coin toss:  whichever flavor just happened to
appear MAX_DISCRIMINATORS//2 + 1 times first determined the final outcome.

I just beat it <wink>:  a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores
punctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both word
bigrams and word unigrams, turned up a low-probability very long spam with a
list of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues!  Yikes.

No matter how often it says Zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so.
Ditto for ZEO.  In contrast, HTML markup has many unique ""words"" that get
0.99.  BTW, this is a clear case where the assumption of
conditionally-independent word probabilities is utterly bogus -- e.g., the
probability that ""<body>"" appears in a message is highly correlated with the
prob of ""<br>"" appearing.  By treating them as independent, naive Bayes
grossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you
get in return is something that can actually be computed <wink>.

Read the ""What about HTML?"" section in tokenizer.py.  From the very start,
I've been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at
python.org, and HTML decorations have so far been too strong a clue to
justify ignoring it in that specific context.  I haven't done anything
geared toward personal email, including the case of non-mailing-list email
that happens to go through python.org.

I'd prefer to strip HTML tags from everything, but last time I tried that it
still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test
results with and without HTML tag stripping is included in the ""What about
HTML?"" comment block).  But as the comment block also says,

# XXX So, if another way is found to slash the f-n rate, the decision here
# XXX not to strip HTML from HTML-only msgs should be revisited.

and we've since done several things that gave significant f-n rate
reductions.  I should test that again now.

> Are there any minable-but-unmined header lines in your corpus left?

Almost all of them -- apart from MIME decorations that appear in both
headers and bodies (like Content-Type), the *only* header lines the base
tokenizer looks at now are Subject, From, X-Mailer, and Organization.

> Or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make
> progress there?

I would need different data, yes.  My ham is too polluted with Mailman
header decorations (which I may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging
the data is a Mortal Sin and I haven't changed a byte so far), and my spam
too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it.  In
particular I have to skip To and Received headers now, and I suspect they're
going to be very valuable in real life (for example, I don't even catch
""undisclosed recipients"" in the To header now!).

Ah!  That explains why the HTML tags didn't get stripped.  I'd again offer
to add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they'd get stripped here
too, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like
a loss <wink>.

I reported on tests I ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from
my corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting
on sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the error
rates I saw were still much better than Jeremy reported when using 500 of
each.


Ah, a full test run just finished, on the

   tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips
a
   trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams

This is the code:

            # Tokenize everything in the body.
            lastw = ''
            for w in word_re.findall(text):
                n = len(w)
                # Make sure this range matches in tokenize_word().
                if 3 <= n <= 12:
                    if w[-1] == 's':
                        w = w[:-1]
                    yield w
                    if lastw:
                        yield lastw + w
                    lastw = w + ' '

                elif n >= 3:
                    lastw = ''
                    for t in tokenize_word(w):
                        yield t

where

    word_re = re.compile(r""[\w$\-\x80-\xff]+"")

This at least doubled the process size over what's done now.  It helped the
f-n rate significantly, but probably hurt the f-p rate (the f-p rate is too
low with only 4000 hams per run to be confident about changes of such small
*absolute* magnitude -- 0.025% is a single message in the f-p table):

It sounds like the flow control is set to Xon/Xoff rather than hardware.

I think that the AT command for hardware flow control is &E4 though this

Those tokenizers are truly trivial to rewrite from scratch if they're
interesting.  The tiny spam/ham collections in GBayes are also worthless
now.  The ""self test"" feature didn't do anything except print its results;
Tester.py since became doctest'ed and verifies that some basic machinery

Dumb Pipeline,"URL: http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/000640
Date: 2002-10-06T21:28:33-06:00

Ted Rall: My Government Went to Afghanistan and All I Got Was This Stupid 
Pipeline[1] 

Summary: The US begun planning courting the Taliban for permission to build an 
oil pipeline since 1997. We even flew Mullah Omar to Texas to try and convince 
him. After it was clear that wouldn't work, we threatened to bomb them and 
begun attacking on a smaller scale for a year before 9-11. We already planned 
to invade two months before the attacks. While it's not clear they knew about 
9-11 it certainly provided a convenient cover for their plans. 

Three days after we started bombing, we begun official work on the pipeline 
Karzai, the Afghanistan president we installed (who incidentally used to work 
for the oil company Unocal and was a former Talib) focused on the pipeline 
rather than rebuilding his torn country. Yet, the entire pipeline is unworkable 
because it's too expensive and will be sabotaged by warlords and Pakistan. 

Bin Laden was essentially a venture capitalist: he funded attacks but didn't 
carry them out. It's far more likely that an Egyptian group, Islamic Jihad, 
carried out the attacks. If we wanted to stop the terrorists, we should have 
gone after them. If we wanted to stop anti-Americanism, we should have gone 
after Saudi Arabia and Pakistan. Instead, our bombing created the perfect 
opportunity for Bin Laden to escape. Nor did we bother to stabilize 
Afghanistan, the country is as ruined as ever. 

""Unfortunately, our government seized the moment as well, not to do good or 
right, but to take advantage--of our grief, of our naivete, of our lust for 
justice and vengeance. They did it to line the pockets of themselves and their 
friends, to gain political and economic advantage for a tiny coterie of 
influential people. In doing so, they endangered the rest of us. They took 
advantage of our ignorance about Islam, Caspian Sea oil and remote Central 
Asia. I have faith that the fundamental goodness of the American people will 
cause them to see what was done in their name, and to do something about it.""

[Razor-users] Problem with Razor 2.14 and Spamassassin 2.41,"This is a multi-part message in MIME format.

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii; format=flowed

I found a nice little Perl script for this purpose called rotate, which 
makes the process of rotating log files very simple.  If there's an 
official source for this script, I couldn't find it.  (My hosting 
provider, pair.com, has it installed, and that's where I found it.) 
 However, redistribution appears to be allowed, so I've attached it.

Good luck...

First Blood is Spilled at Record Industry Hearings[1]. &#8220;In a shocking 
statement made by Back Street Boy, Kevin Richardson, he testified that they 
have NEVER received a royalty check, and that they only took a large advance 
after their third hit album in a row failed to earn them a penny in 
royalties.&#8221;

fwiw, I can't reproduce this with

  spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips=""127.0.0.1""
  spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips=""127.0.0.1, 192.168.1.1""
  spamd --debug --auto-whitelist --allowed-ips=""192.168.1.1, 127.0.0.1""

which I presume is what you meant (except for the missing args
of course).  They all seem to work OK.

------- Additional Comments From jm@jmason.org  2002-10-03 13:29 -------
1. Use of $Config is gradually being removed, thankfully.  I don't want
to see any of that stuff in there if it acn be avoided, as different
perl versions jsut vary so much in that stuff.

2. perl has no concept of where the rules could be -- unless they're in
the perl libdir (/usr/lib/perl5/site_perl/5.x.x/foo).  Perl does not
know about the existence of /usr/share or /etc.  Used to use /usr/lib/perl5
for storing rules, and it was actually *much worse* than it is now. So
we need an out-of-band way to tell SA where to find this stuff. that's
the problem!

3. try ""perl Makefile.PL < /dev/null"" to allow bots to build it.

I think I might be missing some details of what you're peeved about,
though... could you elaborate specifically?

A good plan, needs an implementation though:

hmm. seems down to me.  Basically it's a plan to store hash sums of

  | hmmm, I assume you're going to report this to the nmh folks?

It turns out, when I did some investigation, that my memory of how MH
worked here was wrong (that's not unusual) - the -seq switch seems to
have always done -nolist (requiring a subsequent -list to turn it on
again).

Given that, I have no idea how the pick code as it was ever worked.  In
fact, it quite possibly never did the way it was intended to (I have just
been browsing the 2.5 sources, and that seems to be attempting to do things
that I never saw happen).

It may be that your new sequence method just exposed the bug that had been
there all along.

Given this, I won't be sending any bug reports to the nmh people.  If nmh
ever seems to be showing any signs further progress, and if I remember this
then, I might send them a change request.   The code to make the change is
trivial.

It was a extreme contrived example because you glosded over the 
point of the earlier 3-person example. 

But OK, Mr Math, let it be N men and women, for any N>2. They 
all pair off. Then, some number H, N>H>0, of men has sex with 
all the other N-1 women he hasn't yet had sex with. 

Pick any N and H that might be interesting. Any choice of
values results in meaningful differences between the sexes' 
""promiscuity"", as commonly understood. It should be more 
obvious with extreme choices of numbers, but it is also true 
for any choice of N and H, if unrealistic totals distract you.

Further, and I was hoping this would be clear without saying
so outright, this model actually approximates the cliche 
""common wisdom"" about per-gender sexual behavior, if you 
reverse the male and female roles.

Those stereotypes are: that more men than women seek multiple
partners -- men being ""more promiscuous"" than women -- and that 
surplus of male interest is satisfied by a smaller number of 
hyperpromiscuous women (often derisively labelled ""sluts"").

Nope, now you've amended the meaning of your initial statement to
make it more defensible. What I objected to was:

Robert Harley:
# >The assumption that females of all species tend to be less promiscuous
# >than males simply does not fit the facts, Hrdy contended.
# 
# Well, DUH!!!
# 
# It is perfectly obvious that (heterosexual) promiscuity is exactly,
# precisely identical between males and females.
# 
# Of course the shapes of the distributions may differ.

If you assumed people on FoRK had a clue, would you have needed
to jump in with a patronizing ""DUH!!""? 

If you were talking about fuzzy, typical behavior, would you have 
huffed and puffed with the words ""perfectly obvious"" and ""exactly, 
precisely identical""? 

If your concern was with the ""typical"", why didn't you adopt the 
typical definition of ""promiscuous"", rather than a straw-man
definition which allowed you to interject ""DUH!!"" and mock an
anthrolopology professor's conclusions? 

> Actually, you probably just

You are welcome to that theory!

But here's an alternate theory: when you jump in with a patronizing 
and overblown pronouncement -- e.g. ""DUH!!... perfectly obvious... 
exactly, precisely identical..."" -- and that pronouncement is 
itself sloppy and erroneous, then others may get a kick out of 
popping your balloon.

Then this may be 6 months or more since my guess after 3 beta releases is
that the freeze on package versions for inclusion in the next stable
release (n+1) has already happened, thus you'll have to wait at least for
Red Hat Linux... n+2 :-)

This is why (if it doesn't break anything), I'll maybe release recent

also there's catdoc and wv for Word --> text conversions.  actually, wv
consists of wvWare, which as the manpage says ""converts word documents
into other formats such as PS, PDF, HTML, LaTeX, DVI, ABW"".  HTML would
probably be the best format for use with Plucker/SiteScooper, depending
on how good the DOC --> HTML conversion is.  i haven't used either in
over a year as AbiWord or OpenOffice work well enough.  (prefer AbiWord
for it's light-weight size, but OpenOffice has the better DOC importer.)

don't know which of these are better or worse than the other, but i
figure, ""the more the merrier"". ;-)

AbiWord supports exporting to PalmDoc (.pdb) which is about as
PalmOS-friendly as you can get.  never tried/needed it, but it's listed
there in the ""Save As"" dialog box.

Wine (or CrossOver Office, if you already have it) may support Word
Viewer (free download from Microsoft), but didn't a year or so ago when
i last tried.  Word Viewer is what i used back in the day to convert
Word 97 docs to Word 95, as you could display the Word 97 doc and copy &
paste the text (with formatting) into Word 95, which was the only
version of Word that i had.  anyways, a little nostalgia.

i have a windows (dual-boot) machine, but it only get used by my
significant other and for burning multi-session cd-r/rw.  (is there any
linux gui app that supports cdrecord's multi-session feature?)  since
OpenOffice, i've been able to edit Word docs flawlessly (or at least the
simple Word documents i receive from others).

anyways...

what's the deal with all this latency? it's not like that in other places 
where I've used dsl. i read some story about it being done that way to 
allow greater distances to be covered or something like that. however, my 
knowledge of physics is really only newtonian, and I don't understand how 
worsening latency could possibly improve the reliability of a 2000 foot 
long piece of copper. Perhaps it has something to do with stretching the 
time-space continuum? can someone explain this in words of five syllables 
or less?

I opened her up and had a look and say nothing much. A little orange
LED comes on when I plug her in but that's it, after some googling
I found some reference to re-seating all the parts, but no change.
The problem I'm having is that since the power supply is some Dell

power connectors, I cant figure out weather this is a Mobo prob
or a PSU prob. Just to futily try and drag this back OT, I want

what the problem might be give me a shout.

If you want to do http, C gets pretty muddy (curl is about the best
choice I've found) but I grant you that: No language is the be-all and
end-all.

I envy some of those posting to this list.  I've been in business for
24 years and I haven't yet had the luxury of writing every line of
code for any project. We are always coerced by budgets and time to
maximize the amount of work done elsewhere.  

As much as I hate dealing with someone else's blackbox, as much as
I've spent sleepless nights second-guessing external libs, I've never
ever had the luxury to do otherwise. It must be wonderful to be
responsible for something you are actually responsible for, and I am
so sick of being blamed for other people's design mistakes.

Maybe there's an archive somewhere I need to know about, but I've been
using C since DrDobbs first published SmallC and yet I've never found
any decent LGPL libs cataloged in such a way that I can just type in
the task and get back an API.  Because of Javadoc, which is by no
means perfect, Java provides me the second best catalog of 3rd-party
libs, second only to Perl's CPAN -- Perl is one language I also really
hate with a passion, yet end up using the most for exactly this reason.

For example, take the recent CBC Olympics site: I needed to roll
together a telnet client with a tokenizer, perl-regex preprocessing a
stream to produce parseable XML, project that XML into relational
databases using only the DTD to generate the rdbms schema, and open an
XMLRPC interface to read and post items into the news stream.  Where
can I find C libs for those components?  

On the webserver, we then needed a multithreaded read-only http socket
which can spawn persistent data-caching servlets that periodically

ready for prime-time, and re-inventing that entire shopping list in C
is just not feasible for one programmer to do inside of 8 weeks.

When you need C libs, or even C++ libs, where's the best place to shop?
Where do you find standards-based portable RDBMS API? (ODBC?) How do
you evaluate these things without actually fetching every one and
trying it out?

In a perfect universe, I'd use Ocaml or even Ruby, but I don't see the
social infrastructure for either happening during my professional

And my IBM Intellistation would lock up instantly .. now this is actually

"Our friends the Palestinians, Our servants in government.","
It wasn't gloating, it was one for the horror file.

And of course for the Palestinians it wasn't a mistake, which is a key
part of the horror.

I'm not against American taxpayers remodeling a school honoring a killer

Content-Type: text/plain; charset=us-ascii


I am delurking to comment on the Salon article. I just wanted to say that I am grateful they choose not to publish my forbidden thought. I sent it in a couple of days before the 9/11 commeration. If I had just watched the sentimental network and cable shows on 9/11 my cynical thoughts would have remain unchanged. However, I watch the Frontline show ""Faith and Doubt at Ground Zero"" on PBS. That show tackled head on, with much more courage than I have seen elsewhere, the larger questions about good and evil, about art as an alternate religion (Karlheinz Stockhausen -- 9/11 was a great work of art), and especially the question about how religion has a darker side which when carried to fanatic extremes tends to negate the humanity of the non-believers.
I am not a religious person but I stunned at the scope of this program. It talked about the Lutheran minister who spoke at Yankees Stadium on a podium with other religious leaders present who was charged with heresy by his own church for promoting the idea that all religions are equal (presumably the Lutherans have the one true path?).
Thanks for listening, I just felt like I needed to put the word out about this program. My shallow comment on Salon and others like it (my boyfriend and I had sex while the towers collapsed) gives me pause about how some of us tend to harden ourselves to the suffering of others.

My next (current) task is to complete the corpus I've got - it's currently
got ~ 9000 ham, 7800 spam, and about 9200 currently unsorted. I'm tossing 
up using either hammie or spamassassin to do the initial sort  - previously
I've used various forms of 'grep' for keywords and a little gui thing to 
pop a message up and let me say 'spam/ham', but that's just getting too, too
tedious.

I can't make it available en masse, but I will look at finding some of
the more 'interesting' uglies. One thing I've seen (consider this 
'anecdotal' for now) is that the 'skip' tokens end up in a _lot_ of the 
f-ps.

I simply put it (them) into my (nmh) component files (components,
replcomps, forwcomps and so on).  That way you get them when you are
editing your message.  Also, by using comps files for specific
folders you can alter your .sig per folder (and other tricks).  See
the docs for (n)mh for all the details.

There might (must?) also be a way to get sedit to do it, but I've
been using gvim as my exmh message editor for a long time now.  I
load it with a command that loads some email-specific settings, eg,
to ""syntax"" colour-highlight the headers and quoted parts of an
email)... it would be possible to map some (vim) keys that would add
a sig (or even give a selection of sigs to choose from).

And there are all sorts of ways to have randomly-chosen sigs...

Did I claim ""all gay people are hyperpromiscuous""? For what this is worth,
I would claim they're considerably more promiscuous on the average than
your average het. My utterly unscientific, unsubstatiated claim is that
the typical male would *like* to be considerably more promiscous than your

Look up different reproduction strategies, due to basic hardware

What is silly and antiquated depends a lot on which country you live in.

I don't have statistics on the love half life, but it seems long-term 
relationships use something else for glue.

Clearly our non-silly non-antiquated ideas about relationships have
resulted in mostly short-duration relationships and single-parented,
dysfunctional kids (not enough of them too boot, so to keep our
demographics from completely keeling over we're importing them from places
with mostly silly and antiquated ideas).

At least from the viewpoint of demographics sustainability and
counterpressure to gerontocracy and resulting innovatiophobia we're doing
something wrong.

Maybe we should really go dirty Tleilaxu all the way.

And so I moved the modversions.h file with 281 lines to the empty modversions.h file - and got a different reply after ""make"". The output after I moved the file over mostly looked like this:
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:11:33: linux/modules/adb.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:12:37: linux/modules/af_ax25.ver: No such file or directory
/usr/src/linux-2.4.18-3/linux/modversions.h:13:36: linux/modules/af_ipx.ver: No such file or directory

The odd lines being the path and the first half of the other lines are what's written after the # in the modversions.h file. Should there be a file at each of these (one at each of the 281 lines of the file) that I'd have to compile/make?

It's taken plenty of elbow grease, but I'm glad it hasn't gone smoothly, it's a good learning experience. Again, any help is appreciated. Thanks, Eric

On my box the current system scores about 50 msgs per second (starting in
memory, of course).  While that can be a drag while waiting for one of my
full test runs to complete (one of those scores a message more than 120,000
times, and trains more than 30,000 times), I've got no urge to do any speed
optimizations -- if I were using this for my own email, I'd never notice the
drag.  Guido will bitch like hell about waiting an extra second for his

I haven't profiled yet, but *suspect* there aren't any egregious hot spots.
5-gram'ing of long words with high-bit characters is likely overly expensive
*when* it happens, but it doesn't happen that often, and as an approach to
non-English languages it sucks anyway (i.e., there's no point speeding
something that ought to be replaced entirely).

Errrr....the biz guys in my office don't care what the ""WISPs"" want to do
with their little WiFi networks.  And the bandwidth shadows in most cities
are surprisingly large and common.  They aren't selling the software, which
is pretty pricy as it happens.  They are using it to optimize next
generation wireless canopies over metro areas and fiber networks on a large
scale.  There are an essentially infinite number of metro wireless
configurations, some of which generate far more dead or marginal spots and
others which are very expensive to operate (due to backhaul transit
considerations) or both.  This software can be used as a tool to optimize
the canopy coverage and minimize the actual transit costs since the wireless
is tied into fiber at multiple points.

The canopies we are talking about aren't short-range wifi technologies, but
a mixture of long-range high-performance wireless networking, with bandwidth
measured in tens to hundreds of mbits and ranges measured in miles (up to
well over a hundred miles on the extreme end).  At those ranges and
bandwidth levels, the cost of providing the network can easily vary by an
order of magnitude or more depending on how you manage RF shadows and
proximity to fiber access points.  The idea ultimately is to optimize the
cost and performance such that no existing network infrastructure providers
can remotely compete and maintain profitability.  This is a surprisingly low
bar, and it is about time networks were designed with this level of
large-scale optimization (cost per mbit, maximizing coverage, and effective
bandwidth available per unit area) in any case.  And for this company's
long-term plans, this type of capability will be absolutely necessary to
keep things sane.

Or at least investors find this capability very sexy and compelling,
especially since we have this lovely visualization engine tied into the
system (CLI batches never have the same effect, even if it is more
efficient).

Sigh.

This sprung out of a report linked by Cindy about the promiscuity of

not the tail end of the distribution.  ""By mating with as many

"alk] Reject, Blackhole, or Fake No-User?","This is not directly SpamAssassin related, but more of a general
dealing-with-SPAM issue.

What is the best way to deal with SPAM during the SMTP transaction?
There are domains and addresses that I know are SPAM at the 'MAIL
FROM' and can deal with at the SMTP level. I have been, and I think
most people, respond with a 5.7.1 code, a ""permanent"" error. That
pretty much means, ""Don't bother to try from that address again,
you'll get the same error."" People often add cathartic messages to
accompany the 550 like, ""Spammers must die.""

But this might not be the best way to go. You are telling the spammers
that you are on to them. This may cause them to try other methods to
get around your blocks. Is it perhaps better to blackhole the mail?
That is, act like everything is OK during the SMTP transaction, but
then just drop the mail into the bitbucket. (This is generally how
SpamAssassin works since almost everyone uses it after the SMTP
transaction has completed successfully.) Spammer thinks everything is
going fine and has no reason to try new methods.

Then there is a third possibility. Instead of returning a 550 code
indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is
saying ""mailbox does not exist."" This would be in the hopes that some
spammers out there actually remove names reported as non-existent from
their lists. I know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can
lower the incidence.

So, what are the arguments for each? Do spammers even look at _any_ of
the bounce messages they get? The volume of bounces must be
huge. Personally, I'm starting to think blackholes are the way to
go... But sending back that ""Spammer die, die, die,"" or stock ""Access
DEE-NIED!"" (my ephasis added) message can be pretty satisfying. ;)

  Tadpole's Secure Web Software Subsidiary Endeavors Technology Teams With Web
  Meetings Leader WebEx Communications
  To Provide Best-of-Breed Solution For Extended Group Collaboration During
  and Between Online Meetings

  Web meetings raise the quality of team interaction and communications for
  users of the Web's secure, P2P collaboration network

  ###

  Tadpole Technology plc, the mobile computing and network infrastructure
  group, today announces that its web collaboration subsidiary, Endeavors
  Technology, Inc., has teamed with Web meetings leader, WebEx
  Communications,Inc. to help professionals make better use of corporate time
  and resources, and gain competitive advantage. By integrating the advanced
  communications capabilities of the WebEx platform with Endeavors' secure P2P
  collaboration network, Endeavors has created a new method of world-class
  teamwork and interaction without the hassle of travel.

  With the rapid growth in popularity of Web meetings, the rationale for this
  world-class relationship stems from the growing need for workgroups around
  the world to maintain the quality of the team collaboration experience
  between online meetings. The issue by those preferring not to travel is how
  to continue to collaborate and share information with team members between
  meetings rather than depending on intermittent, insecure email and multiple
  copies of constantly changing documents.

  Inter-meeting collaboration needs an asynchronous medium, independent of
  time. In asynchronous mode, a team member can access, read and edit
  information relevant to the meeting group at his/her convenience rather than
  having to fit into the schedules and timeframes of others. A secured
  environment available only to members of a meeting or project is also
  essential.

  Endeavors' Magi technology converts the Web into a secure platform for
  sharing information directly from people's desktops. WebEx meetings can be
  recorded and reviewed at any time, documents shared in the meeting can be
  actioned in real-time or at a later date, calendars and project schedules
  can be updated at any time, and new individuals added to the workgroup at
  will . all in a secure environment with people working across the globe,
  inside or outside company firewalls.

  Magi peer collaboration securely delivers significant benefits to Web
  meeting participants. Not only can they share and access information at
  will, but they can also know which other participants are online or
  ""present."" This enables them to chat and message each other, search across
  other people's Magi environment, and work jointly on relevant documents
  highly productively. With Magi collaboration, in tandem with WebEx
  conferencing, the savings can be huge in terms of travel costs, phone bills,
  and, most importantly, timely completion of projects and tasks.

  ""In order to realise the full potential of Web meetings, best-of-breed
  services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says
  Bernard Hulme, Tadpole's group chief executive. ""The powerful combination

or-users] Problem with SDK 2.03?,"
I recently brought up a new system - SuSe 7.3 and I am running
spamassassin and procmail, which work fine.

I tried bringing up razor (2.14) but I am not able to get the SDK to
install and razor reports missing modules. They appear to be there. I
followed the installation directions. There appears to be an endless list
of errors. Any ideas on what to do or where to start?

There's lots of similar places.  Saskatchewan, for example, once
shared with Iceland the distinction of most telephone connections per
capita, and for a long time shared the internet penetration lead with
Iceland (Sask is a land-locked massive expanse of ultra-flat dust with
only two rivers and farm sizes measured in the

It's still curious Iceland leads.  Maybe there's just a deep cultural

But RAM is expensive, and the directory structures of many systems (e.g.
Windows) are not sufficiently organized and standardized to make this
combination of bootable CDs and RAM drives practical. Even if you are
fortunate enough to be using Linux (or another FHS-compliant *nix), you
still can't fit a lot on a CD. Its not unusual today to have gigabytes of
static multimedia content on the web server. This particular problem can be
alleviated somewhat by using DVDs, but this is a temporary solution at best
which will become outdated quickly as our data requirements grow and hard
drives become cheaper.

Right. This is why you would consolidate all state of any long-term
significance on just a couple partitions, and why you would not put static
application code on these changeable partitions. Fortunately, most large
client/server application physical architectures do this anyhow, because
these are two fundamentally different kinds of state with two very different
sets of administrative, security, RAID, and backup requirements. People also
tend to do this anyhow because layered logical architectures are popular
with the GUI at one end, business logic in the middle, and persistence
services at the other. This logical architecture maps naturally to a
physical architecture that has a static web server, a static application
server, and a database server that has static and changeable partitions. (I
use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable
because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap
space. Who knows what Windows does internally?)

My point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware RAID
device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image
partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but
solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of
base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the
server is rebooted. If some vendor wished to implement this, they could then
market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that
rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer
overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. The prevention of unauthorized
modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this
particular product. But there are many other techniques out there to defend
application data. But those techniques all assume that your system itself
has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could
help.

I would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a
hardware RAID vendor to implement. (I'm just guessing, of course, with no
knowledge of how hardware RAID works internally.) If anyone knows of such a
product, I'd love to hear about it.

It seems implausible to me that ""shiver"" here means ""to shake""; I don't
recall seeing the word used transitively in that sense, and web1913
lists that sense as ""v. i."", or intransitive.  The transitive sense of
""shiver"", which we no longer use but which people used widely in the
1800s (web1913 doesn't even list it as archaic or obsolete), means
""to shatter into splinters, normally with a blow"".

Shivering a boat's timbers, of course, leaves you with no boat.
(Shivering some of them, which will happen if you hit a rock hard enough,
leaves you with a sinking boat.)

So, ""Shiver my timbers if I do,"" can be reasonably interpreted as a more
vivid way of saying, ""May I die suddenly if I do.""  The interpretation
suggested by Quinion, ""May my boat be damaged,"" neither makes as much
sense in context nor obeys the normal rules of grammar.

I've sent a copy of this to Quinion.

chronous I/O (was Re: Gasp!),"Of course we've had select() since BSD 4.2 and poll() since System V
or so, and they work reasonably well for asynchronous I/O up to a
hundred or so channels, but suck after that; /dev/poll (available in
Solaris and Linux) is one approach to solving this; Linux has a way to
do essentially the same thing with real-time signals, and has for
years; and FreeBSD has kqueue.

More details about these are at
http://www.citi.umich.edu/projects/linux-scalability/

None of this helps with disk I/O; most programs that need to overlap
disk I/O with computation, on either proprietary Unixes or Linux, just
use multiple threads or processes to handle the disk I/O.

POSIX specifies a mechanism for nonblocking disk I/O that most
proprietary Unixes implement.  The Linux kernel hackers are currently
rewriting Linux's entire I/O subsystem essentially from scratch to
work asynchronously, because they can easily build efficient
synchronous I/O primitives from asynchronous ones, but not the other
way around. So now Linux will support this mechanism too.

It probably doesn't need saying for anyone who's read Beberg saying
things like ""Memory management is a non-issue for anyone that has any
idea at all how the hardware functions,"" but he's totally off-base.
People should know by now not to take anything he says seriously, but
apparently some don't, so I'll rebut.

Not surprisingly, the rebuttal requires many more words than the
original stupid errors.

In detail, he wrote:
> Could it be? After 20 years without this feature UNIX finally

> nontrivial apps? No way!

Unix acquired nonblocking I/O in the form of select() about 23 years
ago, and Solaris has had the particular aio_* calls we are discussing
for many years.  Very few applications need the aio_* calls ---
essentially only high-performance RDBMS servers even benefit from them
at all, and most of those have been faking it fine for a while with
multiple threads or processes.  This just provides a modicum of extra
performance.

Although I don't have a copy of the spec handy, I think the aio_* APIs
come from the POSIX spec IEEE Std 1003.1-1990, section 6.7.9, which is
13 years old, and which I think documented then-current practice.
They might be even older than that.

Unix has been multiprocess since 1969, and most Unix implementations
have supported multithreading for a decade or more.

Linux's aio_* routines can notify the process of their completion with
a ""signal"", a feature missing in Microsoft Windows; a ""signal"" causes
the immediate execution of a ""signal handler"" in a process.  By
contrast, the Microsoft Windows mechanisms to do similar things (such
as completion ports) do not deliver a notification until the process

I don't think signals are a better way to do things in this case
(although I haven't written any RDBMSes myself), but you got the
technical descriptions of the two operating systems exactly backwards.
Most programs that use Linux real-time signals for asynchronous
network I/O, in fact, block the signal in question and poll the signal
queue in a very Windowsish way, using sigtimedwait() or sigwaitinfo().

Should be fixed : You probably had libdv-devel installed and MPlayer
automatically detected it. The new spec file explicitely passes
--disable-libdv when the package is rebuilt with --without libdv.

n chariots responsible for Space Shuttle design constraints,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85485894
Date: Not supplied

Ben Hammersley posts a parable about design specifications, showing the link 
between Roman Chariots and the Space Shuttle. It has the ring of something 
apocraphyl to me, but it's a good read, nevertheless. 

    The U.S. standard railroad gauge (distance between the rails) is 4 feet, 
    8.5 inches. That is an exceedingly odd number. Why was that gauge used? 
    Because that's the way they built them in England, and the U.S. railroads 
    were built by English expatriates. 

    Why did the English build them that way? Because the first rail lines were 
    built by the same people who built the pre-railroad tramways, and that's 
    the gauge they used. 

    Why did ""they"" use that gauge? Because the people who built the tramways 
    used the same jigs and tools that they used for building wagons, which used 
    that wheel spacing. 

    So why did the wagons have that particular odd spacing? Well, if they tried 
    to use any other spacing, the wagon wheels would break on some of the old, 
    long distance roads in England, because that was the spacing of the wheel 
    ruts... 

Snopes says it's false[1], but from their notes, it appears that it's actually 
largely true, albeit subject to interpretation. Link[2] Discuss[3]

Weird.  I had no problems at all rebuilding from the SRPM with specfile
modified to enable the bytecode interpreter.  The ""check-files"" test
warns that ""/usr/share/aclocal/freetype2.m4"" was not included in any

I'm not seeing a hit on 'next'. A quick ""just pound on 'next' and watch the

so it's well under 250ms per switch, but I'm seeing a really piggy CPU spike

related to number-of-folders:

Strange... all my openssh packages don't explicitly requires a version of
openssl. What version of openssh do you have? Is it an official Red Hat
package? I suppose it isn't, and using Red Hat's rpms will solve your
problem.

What you need to know for openssl is :
0.9.5b is libcrypto.so.0 and libssl.so.0
0.9.6  is libcrypto.so.1 and libssl.so.1
0.9.6b is libcrypto.so.2 and libssl.so.2

Now in all Red Hat packages I've seen so far, the only dependency is on
those files and not on ""openssl = version"".

China?  Ooops, no wait, scratch that.

There is one counter example that I can think of, but it may not be
precisely ""free trade/markets"" -- when Ben Franklin first visited
England he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous.  Ben
explained that they used ""Colonial Script"", a kind of barter-dollar,
and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment.  The
British bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to
clamp down on the practice.  Within a few years, the colonies were
rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the Empire.

According to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political
party here in Canada, the Founding Fathers had no real complaint about
tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were
protesting. If this is true, then it comes right back to the forces
that killed Ned Ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes
they were protesting a tea tax.  The same pamphlet claimed that Canada
was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the
late-50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the
juristiction of parliament and handed over to the Bank of Canada.

I've wondered about all this.  Certainly the timeline of the collapse
of the Canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of
other causes (for example, spending money like we had 300M people when
we only had 20M) Anyone have any further information on this?

I've never installed source rpms with apt, but I suppose that if you get
file not found, it's because the source rpm was installed. To see if this
is the case, go to /usr/src/redhat/SPECS/ and if you see mplayer.spec,
you'll just need to do ""rpm -bb mplayer.spec"" to get a binary build in

[VoID] a new low on the personals tip...,"-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA1

I know it's not the popular choice for a lot of people, but I'd
suggest, um, church. :-). Like Woody Allen said, 90% of life is
showing up, right?


Almost anyone can find a church where the sermons don't make you bust
out laughing, and you're set. I, for instance, am a Unitarian, which,
as someone once observed, is merely a decompression chamber between a
real church and a golf course. (ObUUJokes: Mid 70's bumper-sticker:
""Honk if you're not sure""; Lenny Bruce: ""Did you hear about how the
Klan burned a question mark on the Unitarian's lawn?""; ""Unitarians
would rather go to a discussion group about heaven than to heaven
itself.""; ""Unitarians pray 'to whom it may concern'""; etc...)

But, seriously, folks, my teenage-adopted denomination (I'm, um,
lapsed, on several fronts, a Dutch-Reformed-turned-atheist father and
an agnostic mother who used to be a southern Baptist of some stripe
or another) and frankly limousine liberal secular-humanist
congregation is about as orthogonal to my present
congenital-Republican small-l libertarian turned anarchocapitalist
politics as it is possible to be (except for the secular-humanist
bit...), and I still go pretty regularly, though not as much as I
used to. Heck, the older I get the less of the divine I believe in.
I'm asymptotically approaching my father's atheism, these days, and I
show up at least once a month. Nice folks though, when I can keep a
civil tongue in my head -- smart too, when I can't and end up arguing
with them. :-).


Anyway, if *I* can end up hitched, anyone can. Talk about orthogonal.
I met my practically-socialist state-education-bureaucrat wife one
year after I started, moved in with her 6 weeks later :-), married
her 2 years after that, and I wasn't even trying meet women. I was
just looking to make friends as I was new in town.


The trick to the church thing is, whatever denomination/congregation
you end up in, expect to end up with a mate, not a date. I mean, some
guys manage to stay single, but most, like me, don't. You can
practically see the laser-sights light up when you walk into a
room...

That's because, of course, most churches are *run* by women. Most
regular attendants are women. Hell, 65% of all new *ministers*, in
protestant denominations, at least, are women. No matter your age,
looks, intelligence, whatever, you'll end up surrounded by women.
You'll be outnumbered, even several to one -- some of whom are at
least better looking than you are. :-). The only place where there
are *more* women running things is in grass-roots Republican politics
- -- but I won't go there, I promise.


If I may make a presumption here, since you brought it up, I figure
that between the sophistication and diversity of the subcontinent's
religions, and the ubiquity of Indians in various stages of
assimilation in So/NoCal, you can find some place to hang out near
you, Rohit. You probably don't even have to go, um, native, like I
did -- backsliding on my own ostensibly rational godless upbringing
and becoming, horrors, a Unitarian...

ory of the tilde,"URL: http://diveintomark.org/archives/2002/10/04.html#history_of_the_tilde
Date: 2002-10-04T00:27:41-05:00

So I was researching the history of the tilde, because D told me that her 
company just installed a new web proxy that denies access to any URL with a 
tilde in it. Presumably because the presence of a tilde indicates with 
remarkable accuracy a personal site, and apparently her employer believes that 
reading personal sites is not an appropriate use of company time. Which, to be 
honest, is probably accurate, given the nature of her work. But never mind 
that. I don't want to talk about corporate politics. I want to talk about the 
tilde. 

Every command-line-loving geek will tell you that ~ stands for &#8220;home 
directory&#8221;, and cd ~ will take you to your home directory. (cd ~username 
will take you to someone else's, except on Mac OS X, where it will take you to 
their Public file sharing directory.) It is from this heritage that we can 
trace the present-day practice of using tildes in URLs to denote personal 
pages, since one single system-wide configuration allowed individual users to 
have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. Or, more 
commonly now that Apache has taken over the world, in their public_html 
subdirectory, except on Mac OS X, where if you turn on web sharing and point 
your browser to http://localhost/~username/, you're actually being served files 
from that user's Sites directory within their home directory. 

But I don't want to talk about Mac OS X. I want to talk about the tilde. 

As with so many other things, I find that Jukka Korpela[1] is the expert in 
this field. Jukka is no doubt a member of my karass[2], a word which Google (
old habits die hard[3]) feels is best explained by the personal site of Eugene 
Wallingford, which, like Jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a 
tilde. 

In fact, Jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be 
used in URLs[4], a treatise which, I feel obliged to point out, contains a 
tilde in its URL. 

Clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. 

Digging further, we find this post of Jukka's from 1998[5], in which we learn 
that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd 
character called the overline. Presumably to balance out the underline, if 
indeed those sorts of things require balance. There is balance in the universe, 
to be sure, but I am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. No matter. 
The tilde was the tilde so that Spanish-typing types could type the &ntilde; 
(now referenced in HTML as the named entity &ntilde;), but somewhere along 
the line, it morphed into a general-purpose character with all sorts of geeky 
uses. 

Digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 
#[6], then an alternate for ^, and its life as an overline replacement came 
even later. Jukka confirms this[7] and adds a timeline: 1963 for #, 1964 for ^, 
1966 for overline. Then June 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an X3 committee 
meeting, when it was proposed &#8220;as exclusively a tilde in USA to appease 
SHARE&#8221;. I can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or 
what this committee meeting was about. The next reference isn't until 1991, 
when the tilde was officially added to ISO-646[8]. 

And now, down the rabbit hole we go. Scouring Usenet (which the kids of 
yesterday called &#8220;Deja News&#8221;, and kids today call &#8220;Google 
Groups&#8221;), we find a reprint of a 1991 William Safire (yes, _that_ William 
Safire) article On Language[9], in which we learn that ~ is officially 
pronounced &#8220;squiggle&#8221;. This is confirmed by the Jargon Dictionary
[10] to this very day. I'm not sure this is useful, but I just thought it was 
cool to see William Safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various 
ASCII characters. 

As early as August 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem
[11]. 

In July 1989, Kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde[12]. 

In February 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that 
Fidonet supported ASCII characters space through tilde[13]. 

As early as January 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past EOF[14]. 

As early as July 1986, troff supported the tilde[15]. 

In November 1985, a mod.sources post refers to Bourne shell enhancements 
(history,tilde,job control)[16]. 

As early as January 1984, tilde was included on the DEC keyboard[17] and listed 
in the APL-11 character set[18]. 

In April 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi[19] (actually due to underlying 
bugs in csh). 

In December 1982, ~ is officially pronounced &#8220;tilde&#8221;[20], prompting 
this typographical pun[21]. 

And that's the earliest reference I can find. 

So where does that leave us? Unsatisfied, no doubt. There is history here, but 
there are gaps. What happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? How did the 
tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? When did it become a synonym for 
&#8220;home directory&#8221;? When did it migrate into the world of web servers 
to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web 
sites? I don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing 
my research, a failing for which I apologize profusely. Goodnight, goodnight. 
May you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls.

No offense or anything, but there's a difference between holding a
sign that doesn't agree with Bush and screaming at him.

My sole point, as far as the 1st Amendment goes is that there is more
to this game than just being an angry, liberal youth.  (Which is the
gross culmination of everyone's argument sofar)  The screaming isn't
the most effective method around.  I don't believe I argued that it
was.  But screaming is happening because the means to communicate to
the representatives involved are diminishing, at least as far as the
people doing the screaming are concerned.   For the record, I don't
support the screamers in organized conferences (Such as the Colin
Powell shout-down that was mentioned earlier).  I don't think that
this is what the 1st Amendment was implying.  These folks -do- have a
right to be heard, and I think they have a right to be heard by the
folks they elected in the first place.

My point, (my only point) was really more concerned with the cases
such as Mr. Nell.   He wasn't engaged (at least from the limited facts
we have) in a shoutout, but rather in a difference of opinion.   He
has a right to possess this opinion and make it known  to the
representatives that are elected.   A sign is not a shout-out.

I think I may have missed (or not accurately addressed) the original
thread switch that took this example and mixed in the screaming
dissenters to the mix.  I was mostly responding with my miffedness in
having broad-brush strokes applied to a group without examining the
policy reasons that might have contributed to it.   IN this case, the
screaming parties are fed up with getting corralled miles away from
the folks they need to speak with.   They're resorting to creative,
offensive and constitutionally challengable means, but its not simply
due to the fact that they're 20 and have lost all decorum.   The 'My
generation never did this ' is all BS.   THere's more to this story,
we just dont' know it all.

I hope this clarifies my position.   For the quick rehash:

Screaming != Free speech on all cases.
Dissent = Free speech, provided you follow what has been laid down by
the Supremes.

K?

 Null, the third beta was out last week.

 It'll be an interesting release. Gnome 2.0, and GCC 3.2 - both very new,
large projects.

 I'd not be putting it on any production machines for a while...

 Though many say ""RedHat X.0 releases are rubbish"" - it's worth baring in
mind that they jump a release when the underlying archtechture changes, not
just the installer, so they are .0 for a reason.

That's just apt's way of telling you the package is in ""AllowDuplicated"", 
meaning multiple versions of the package can be installed at the same 
time. Yes the output is a bit strange.. especially when there's only one 
version available.

'apt-get install kernel-source#2.4.18-3' will install it...

Re[3]: Selling Wedded Bliss (was Re: Ouch...),"Here are numbers that come from a study of a couple of thousand swedes, with 
no reference to sexual preference that I could find. The point would seem to 
be that (1) sexual activity follows a power curve, with a few people, a la 
Wilt Chamberlain, having an extaordinarily large number of sexual contacts, 
ev en in a short period of time and (2) a tendency for men to have more 
partners than women.  I have no idea, being a statistical ignoramus, whether 
the fact that there seem to be more men than women at the extremely 
promiscuous end of the sex-partners-distribution curve means that you'd get 
even more extreme results in a group of men who chiefly have sex with other 
men. 


http://polymer.bu.edu/~amaral/Sex_partners/Content_sex.html

<<For example, the mean number of partners since sexual initiation for women 
is approximately 7 and in a sample of less than 1500 Swedish women we find an 
individual with 100 partners. For men, the mean is approximately 15 and we 
find an individual with 800 partners, which is almost 50 times larger than 
the mean! So, somehow Don Juan was not such an extraordinary case but just 
one data point in a wide spectrum of behaviors that can be observed. >>


As for gay men: There is indeed anecdotal evidence of cases of extreme 
promiscuity among gay men. You can read about it in Randy Schiltz's And the 
Band Played On. He writes about  bathhouse culture pre-HIV; he also discusses 
how, in the gay politics of the time, there was a sub-culture of what you 
might call radical gay men who argued (and acted on the argument) that having 
many partners was an essential part of what being gay actually was. It was an 
explicitly political statement: monogamy is an artifact of straight culture.
    That view seems to have died, in more ways than one. Part of the point of 
Schiltz's book was to condemn the role that it and  bathhouse culture played 
in spreading the AIDs epidemic that eventually killed Schiltz, among so many 
others. This doesn't let Eugen off the hook--but it is accurate to say that 
there was a  cult of promiscuity that was particular to the gay community.

G] PPPD disconnects on me!,"Hello folks!
I'm new to Linux, so here goes...
I've been trying to get connected to the outside world through my modem.
I've got Debian with kernel 2.4.18.
I've got this Win-Modem(yes, I know) and managed to locate a proper driver
for it.
Minicom is very much able to dial out.
But there seems to be a problem with my PPPD installation.
When I type 'ppp' in the minicom terminal, all I get (after the initial info
of my dynamic IP, etc) is a ~ and then the NO CARRIER signal.
Then I looked into calling pppd directly using chat.
I used this command:  pppd call Provider (where Provider is some script
somewhere).
It dials, it connects, it sends my username & password, and when connection
is established, it gives the SIGHUP signal and exits.
This is confirmed when me friend and I tried to connect through a serial
port using pppd to connect ttyS0.  I ran pppd waiting for a connection, me
friend tried connecting and as soon as he did, pppd exited.

Some expert help would be greatly appreciated as I'm sick and tired of
having to reboot, get into Windoze to hook up to the net and then back to
Linux, mounting this drive to get that file, etc.  It'd be nice never have
to go back to Windoze(except for games, that is).

Thanks a million.

_Jeffrey Zeldman_: Party like it's 1997[1]. &#8220;Microsoft has redesigned. 
Its new layout uses font tags and other deprecated junk straight out of the 
mid-1990s. ... When a W3C member company that helped create XHTML and CSS 
ignores or misuses those web standards on its corporate site, you have to 
wonder who didn't get the memo.&#8221; 

The new design also fails even the most basic accessibility tests[2]; the home 
page contains 80 instances of images without ALT text. This is the same basic 
failing for which the Sydney Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games was 
successfully sued in 2000[3]. 

Here is what microsoft.com looks like in a text-only browser[4]. (To better 
understand the experience, take a piece of paper and cover your entire monitor 
except for the top line, then scroll the window slowly so you can only read one 
line at a time.) While nothing is technically locked out (all the links are 
regular links, nothing requires Javascript to function properly), all the 
un-ALT-enhanced images (which are mostly spacer images and images-as-bullets) 
add so much clutter to the page that it's very difficult to navigate. 

Meanwhile, I don't want to imagine what it would sound like through a screen 
reader. Want to find the search box? That's &#8220;1pttrans dot gif 1pttrans

[ILUG] Sun Solaris..,"On Thu, Aug 22, 2002 at 05:13:01PM +0100, Fergal Moran mentioned:
> In a nutshell - Solaris is Suns own flavour of UNIX.

 Though I'm sure that this nice person would like a bit more detail.

 Solaris is quite different to Linux, though these days you can make
solaris act a lot like linux with an extra CD of GNU tools Sun ship with
solaris. It is based on the SysV unix family, so it's quite similar to
other unixen like HPUX and SCO.

 Sun's hardware in general is more reliable, and a lot more expensive. One
of the main bonuses you get by buying Sun is that you are getting your
hardware and software from one company, so if you have a support contract,
they have to fix it. They can't fob you off with 'that's a software
problem, talk to the software vendor.' etc.

 If you are set on Linux, you most likely can do your own support. There
is then a world of different hardware options. You can run Linux on Sparc,
though some companies like RedHat don't maintain a sparc port anymore.

 You can also buy your machine from linux-oriented companies like DNUK,
who do machines designed to run linux, and their own version of linux,
that has a few extras for their machines. Or, you can get a machine from a
cheaper company like Dell, and it'll most likely work, most of the time.

And further, why focus on the fact they were laid off and not on the
fact they were hired in the first place?

BTW: I saw someone claim that aside from the efficiency of the market
there were also gains to society from irrational behavior.

If a society has business people that systematically overestimate their
chances, that is bad for the businessmen but on net a big gain for
society.  On the social level, the law of averages works to societies
benefit in a manner it can't for an individual.

A key reason, in this view, that the US wound up outperforming England
was that the English investors were too rational for their societies own
good.

(Except, of course, when US investors were bilking them to build canals
and railroads over here.  Thanks, guys.)

Applied to telecom: a lot of dark wire (glass) and innovation will
eventually be used for pennies on the dollar, the benefits to society

I'm not sure what you're doing, but suspect you're storing individual

directly.

I'm not interested in optimizing anything yet, and get many benefits from
the *ease* of working with utterly vanilla Python instance objects.  Lots of
code all over picks these apart for display and analysis purposes.  Very few
people have tried this code yet, and there are still many questions about it
(see, e.g., Jeremy's writeup of his disappointing first-time experiences
today).  Let's keep it as easy as possible to modify for now.  If you're
desparate to save memory, write a subclass?

alk] Some Stupid Questions,"As the subject line indicates, I'm sure these are stupid questions, but
I'm having trouble getting SA working like I understand it should work,
and have about given up on trying to figure it out myself.

If a user has a line like:

whitelist_from *@yahoogroups.com

in his .spamassassin/user_prefs file, does that line not, in effect,
tell the program to take no action at all against any mail coming in from
yahoogroups.com, or is there still checking being done against it?  And if
the latter, what does he need to place in user_prefs to cause such mail
to be ignored?  I'm testing SA here with a few users who happen to be on
yahoogroups lists, before deploying it system-wide, and although the above
line has been added to their user_prefs files, much of their list mail is
still going to the spam folder due to all the usual things you would
expect to trigger SA.

Thanks in advance for any help.

I think this is probably the best way, because I think (maybe) with upgrading you
do not always automatically get the latest feature enabled in some config file
because RH would rather take it easy and not update that config file (you get a
rpmnew instead of rpmsaved file) so they get less calls to support that way.

Anyway, I have tons of media files in /home/* probably 5 to 10 gigs at least, my
laptop's CDROM takes 700MB at a time (obviously) and compressing media files is
dumb because they are already compressed. Dumb question: how to backup huge data?
Network backup to another box? I do not have a box with a tape drive, but maybe box
with a large HD with much free space could take the backup (oops, I do not have a
space computer with a large HD with much free space).

These media files are backed up - ON THE CD'S THEY CAME FROM! Yes I learned that
used CDs make inexpensive backup copy on the shelf. I do not want to re-rip all
this crap again.

its new, correct .xmhcache overwritten with an incorrect one when I switch

I've sent in some spam that either didn't score or scored practically 
nothing, like below 5.  I figure that most people run at 5 so if it 
scores less than that, a rule needs to be honed to catch it.

Well, unfortunately, I appear to be using a window manager that doesn't 
support the icon window.

However, I did fix some bugs in the related ""Hide When Empty"" functionality 
which may solve the issue.  You may need to remove ""unseen"" from the ""always 
show sequences"" to make this work.  If so, let me know so I can put that in 
the help window for ""Icon Window"" as it already is for ""Hide When Empty"".

 This is a pain. 

 The only way you can resolve this, to my knowledge is to download the
original libvorbis rpm and the new one. Remove the old one, then do:

 rpm -Uvh libvorbis-*

 RPM then assumes that you want both versions installed at the same time,
and does so. Why you can't do this after you have one library already
installed is beyond me.

I don't endorse the whole RIAA thing, but to be accurate, you would
have to duplicate the chair so that both you and your neighbour could
continue to sit down, and yes, I suppose that would be more serious.

They can sit on /your/ copy, but if you start churning out exact dups
of a name-brand artifact, people with law degrees start to smell
money.  For example, I could copy a Gibson Guitar /exactly/ so long as
(a) I don't put Orville's name on the headstock and (b) I license the
patented bracing methods.  If I instead try to sell a homebuilt guitar
on eBay with ""Gibson"" written in crayon on the headstock, and then
claim it is a true Les Paul limited edition, I expect people would get
upset.

    M> Why is it that people don't understand that giving stuff away
    M> is a perfectly acceptable tactic in capitalist businesses?  

To play the Devil's Advocate here, it's not about giving /stuff/ away,
it is about granting endless and cascading duplication/distribution
rights.  Even if _I_ only make the copy I give to you, that doesn't
stop you from making 10000 copies to sell.

    M> Access to free stuff often helps to sell other stuff.  

This is the difficult question:  How will they draw the distinction?
The ""other stuff"" is just as easy to duplicate as the free stuff.
This is why MS is hunting people with illegal Windows; it's no harder
to dup than a Linux CD, only what is there that actually prevents
people from doing it?

Personally, I don't think the issue should have anything to do with
sales or units.  The issue is that basic phallacy that says a suit
should be able to ""own"" someone else's intellectual property.  Sarah
McLaughlin isn't suing you, it's her label's legal dept because it's
the label who stands to lose; Sarah's already fat beyond her wildest
dreams, so a few bucks here or there, or even if the well dried up
tomorrow, it's not going to really traumatize her (unless she's been
blazingly stupid with her money)

But the label ... like Disney and Mickey, they need the cash cow so
they can keep all sorts of uncreative hangers-on in limos and coke.
If you thought only Elvis or Brian Jones or Dennis Wilson had problems
with beautiful-people deadbeat leech ""friends"" draining their riches,
think again.

The problem is really very simple because it is semantic, and until we
make the semantic flip, it's unsolvable, but like trisecting an angle,
all it takes is looking at the same situation in a different
way.  Here's the revelation: Elvis never ever made a hit record.

Elvis didn't make the hits, his /fans/ made the hits.  His fans did
the work cleaning toilets, manning the convenience stores, driving
milk trucks, sitting at endless office desks, they did the /real/
labour that paid for every last one of Elvis Presley's pills.  All
Elvis did was sing into a microphone every so often, and pen or
collect the odd song that all those /people/ liked and wanted as
something of their own.  But it's not _Elvis_ who made them universal
statements, it is the universe of fans who slurped the songs into
their own lives, it was pull-technology, not push.

Therefore the question becomes: how many times must these fans pay
before they own what they themselves have created?  They pay royalties
for listening to the radio, for blank tapes, for concert tickets, for
a beer in a bar with a cover band ... they pay over and over and over
again for the /right/ to make some hack writer's song /their/
favourite song????  That's where the whole system has been seriously
warped by the record companies and ad companies reframing it into your
thinking that it is the Elvis who makes the Elvis.  It's not.  It's
the people who make them; the songs are already theirs.

That was my thinking.  My recollection about the first message being valid
is that the ftoc code wants to find that message to start its highlighting,
for example, or you are selecting a message to display.

glob -nocomplain $mhProfile(path)/$folder *
will return an unsorted list of the directory's contents.
But the thought of keeping an in memory list of valid messages is not fun.
Exmh already maintains in-core lists of messages in sequences, which is
already pretty tricky

In some places I maintain caches of files by checking their modify time,
but the sequence files are soo small that by the time you stat them to
check their date stamp, you could just read them again.  Also, now that
we checkpoint message state on every message view, that file will change
every time.  In the old days exmh used to cache a bunch of state about
the folder.

You could build your own apt-repository. Just mirror the needed directories
(e.g. by using a wget cron job), symlink the needed rpms and recreate the
repository. It is already worth the trouble, if you have more than one
installation.

In any case in order to acces the mentioned places, somebody must keep such a

zteana] Moscow bomber,"Man Threatens Explosion In Moscow 

Thursday August 22, 2002 1:40 PM
MOSCOW (AP) - Security officers on Thursday seized an unidentified man who
said he was armed with explosives and threatened to blow up his truck in
front of Russia's Federal Security Services headquarters in Moscow, NTV
television reported.
The officers seized an automatic rifle the man was carrying, then the man
got out of the truck and was taken into custody, NTV said. No other details
were immediately available.
The man had demanded talks with high government officials, the Interfax and
ITAR-Tass news agencies said. Ekho Moskvy radio reported that he wanted to
talk with Russian President Vladimir Putin.
Police and security forces rushed to the Security Service building, within
blocks of the Kremlin, Red Square and the Bolshoi Ballet, and surrounded the
man, who claimed to have one and a half tons of explosives, the news
agencies said. Negotiations continued for about one and a half hours outside
the building, ITAR-Tass and Interfax reported, citing witnesses.
The man later drove away from the building, under police escort, and drove
to a street near Moscow's Olympic Penta Hotel, where authorities held
further negotiations with him, the Moscow police press service said. The
move appeared to be an attempt by security services to get him to a more
secure location.

Gimme a break.  This is remarkable for its lack of
newsworthiness.

1) Bletchley Park used optical sensors, which were (and
still are) the best way to read paper tape at high speed.
You can read about it in the standard accounts, e.g.
  http://www.picotech.com/applications/colossus.html

2) For decades before that, codebreakers were using optical
computing in the form of superposed masks to find patterns.
You can read about it in Kahn.

3) People have been doing opto-electronic computing for
decades.  There's a lot more to it than just holography.
I get 14,000 hits from

It isn't right to make it sound like three numbers (frequency,
amplitude, and phase);  actually there are innumerable
frequencies, each of which has its own amplitude and phase.

Not ""FFTs"".  FTs.  Fourier Transforms.  All you need for

All optical???  No optoelectronics anywhere???
That's medicinal-grade pure snake oil, USP.

Photons are well known for not interacting with

Goodbye Global Warming,"
For anyone to fully bury global warming, they would have to bury the
Greens.  A Green once said that if the Spotted Owl hadn't existed they
would have had to invent it.  So it is with global warming.  Their
fundamental opposition isn't to a warmer earth, it is to industrial
civilization.

The fact that the sattelites didn't match what the global warming
theorists said should be there is old news.  The news here is that the
temperature measures via sattelite have gotten even better and they have
been validated with a different means of measurement.

Rather than have to defend CO2 concentrations as not causing global
warming, people who believe in CO2 need a good explanation of the
""Medieval Warm Period"".  Said period was warmer than what we have now,
and it obvioiusly wasn't caused by CO2.

In point of fact the predicted global warming due to CO2 is not caused
DIRECTLY by CO2.  CO2 doesn't trap that much heat.  Water vapor does,
and if you can get more water vapor in the air due to CO2 then you have
your warming theory.

Yet it would seem that the very stability of the earth's climate over
long periods argues not for an unstable system with positive feedback
loops but one where negative feedback loops predominate.

More water vapor can increase temperatuers, but that also leads to more
clouds.  Clouds both trap heat and reflect it, so it depends a great
deal on how the cloud formation shakes out.  Most climate models admit
they do clouds very poorly.

Yeah, that's exactly what I was doing--I didn't realize I was incurring
administrative pickle bloat this way.  I'm specifically trying to make
things faster and smaller, so I'm storing individual WordInfo pickles
into an anydbm dict (keyed by token).  The result is that it's almost 50
times faster to score messages one per run our of procmail (.408s vs
18.851s).

However, it *does* say all over the place that the goal of this project
isn't to make the fastest or the smallest implementation, so I guess
I'll hold off doing any further performance tuning until the goal starts
to point more in that direction.  .4 seconds is probably fast enough for
people to use it in their procmailrc, which is what I was after.

That's probably what I'll do if I get too antsy :)

Congratulations Chris, you just made the hall of fame!! Speed is much better now. I haven't done any tests, but I'd say that latency dropped 2-3 times and we're back in good shape again.

	You could try antiword (http://www.winfield.demon.nl/linux/).
It's consoled based and converts word 6+ docs to text and some images to

Your running mailscanner and the timeout used got to check ORDB-RBL is too

/From Tad Spencer/: ""Please could you tell me where the phrase /shiver 
my timbers/ originated?""

This is one of those supposedly nautical expressions that seem to be 
better known through a couple of appearances in fiction than by any 
actual sailors' usage.

It's an exclamation that may allude to a ship striking some rock or 
other obstacle so hard that her timbers shiver, or shake, so implying a 
calamity has occurred. It is first recorded as being used by Captain 
Frederick Marryat in /Jacob Faithful/ in 1835: ""I won't thrash you Tom. 
Shiver my timbers if I do"".

It has gained a firm place in the language because almost fifty years 
later Robert Louis Stevenson found it to be just the kind of old-salt 
saying that fitted the character of Long John Silver in /Treasure 
Island/: ""Cross me, and you'll go where many a good man's gone before 
you ... some to the yard-arm, shiver my timbers, and some by the board, 
and all to feed the fishes"". Since then, it's mainly been the preserve 
of second-rate seafaring yarns.

There are specific statutory exemptions to the ""first sale"" principle of
fair use in the US.  For example, audio recordings have such an
exemption (dating from the early '80s IIRC), which is why you can't
(legally) be in the business of renting audio CDs; the creators can
control what you do with it after they've sold it to you.  Certain
industries would like to extend similar exemptions to other products --
there is no theoretical limit to what Congress could revoke such
privileges on.

The problem with the entertainment industry is that they engage in
business and pricing tactics that make anything Microsoft was ever
accused of pale in comparison.  If they can't figure out how to make
money doing something, they'll actually burn money to make sure no
""industry outsider"" can either for all intents and purposes; control is
more important than maximizing profit as long as they can make a
profit.  They don't need your carrot, so they only engage in reasonable
business behavior when you are carrying a very large stick, and few
people swing a stick large enough.  They are being chronically
""investigated"" by the DoJ for anti-trust, collusion, and similar
activities, but that is mostly just for show.

Which isn't to say that the entertainment industry won't fall victim to
its own stupidity, but their ability to do arbitrary and capricious
price manipulation with impunity is going to make it a slow decline.

"zteana] Height, weight, girth, etc","http://www.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,3604,781616,00.html

Britons stand tall, if slightly heavy, in Europe

John Carvel, social affairs editor
Wednesday August 28, 2002
The Guardian

Not every European dimension has been harmonised in Brussels yet. According
to the Department for Trade and Industry, the average Briton stands head,
shoulders, girth and bottoms above their continental partners.
The figures come in a new edition of the department's handbook of
anthropometric and strength measurements, compiled by ergonomists at the
University of Nottingham to help manufacturers design products to fit
people's shape.
The volume provides 294 measurements ranging from the distance between the
inner corners of the eyes to the length of the leg between the crease below
the buttock to the crease at the back of the knee.
It has discovered that the average British man is 36 millimetres (1 inches)
taller than his French counterpart.
The mean height of UK citizens is 1,755.1mm (5ft 9in). Among European men
only the Dutch are taller, averaging 1,795mm and with a clear height
advantage over the US men's average of 1,760.4.
The average British woman is 1,620mm tall (just under 5ft 4in), compared
with 1,604mm for her French counterpart, 1,610mm for the Italians and
1,619mm for the Germans. Swedish women average 1,640mm, Dutch 1,650mm and
Americans 1,626.7mm
More disturbingly, British men and women are heavier than all the other
nationalities except the Americans, averaging 79.75 kilos for British men
and 66.7 for women.
The average British woman has a chest measurement of 1,007.8mm (39.7
inches), compared with 965mm for the Italians, 912.6mm for the Japanese and
806mm for Sri Lankans. American women also top this scale with an average of
1,047.2mm.
The average British woman's waist is 840.6mm (33 inches) - also second
largest behind the Americans. But her bottom at 873.7mm is considerably
smaller than the Italians at 916mm who beat the Americans into second place.
The average British male foot is 266.8mm long (10.5 inches), 6mm longer than
the French and Germans, 3mm more than the Italians and 1mm more than the
Swedes. But they are just beaten by the Americans at 267.8mm and massively
outstripped by the Dutch at 275mm.
However Dutch women have daintier feet than the British, averaging 240mm
compared with 241.1mm in the UK (9.5 inches). German women average 242mm,
compared with 245mm for the Swedes and 242.1mm for the Americans.
The DTI has a less than exhaustive record of ring finger lengths, but on the
available evidence the British man's finger at 78.7mm (3.1 inches) is 1.7mm
longer than his German counterpart, but 0.2mm shorter than the American
average.
The British woman's ring finger at 72.6mm is 0.4mm smaller than her German
counterpart and 0.3mm smaller than the American.
Beverley Norris, research fellow at Nottingham university's institute for
occupational ergonomics, said the figures were useful for product designers.
The department has recently completed a study of the pulling force needed to
open ring pull cans.

limits put to a test,"
XviD [1] is a project to make GPL divx codecs. Sigma Designs [1] is a
company  looking to put out hardware to playback, amongst other things,
divx files. Problem is Sigma is using XviDs gpled code in ways not very
gpl. The  results....XviD stops work on thier code and ask the users to
put preasure  on Sigma to honor the GPL.

Some notes from other places....

>>From Doom9 [3]
""XviD development has been stopped! The Sigma Designs REALMagic MPEG-4
Video Codec contains wide portions of code taken from the XviD project.
Soon after the initial release of the REALMagic codec the XviD developers
have contacted Sigma and informed them about the GPL violation (for those
who don't know, XviD is distributed under the GNU Public License - GPL -
which demands that if you modify a GPL program you have to release it
under the GPL, which in this case means that the source code of the Sigma
codec must be freely available). Sigma promised to replace the stolen
code, but the new version of the codec which was released this month only
disguises the stolen code, it was not actually removed. Sigma was once
again contacted and asked to remove the offending code but until today
nothing has happened. Therefore the XviD team is now turning to the public
in the hope to receive wide public support in their efforts to convince
Sigma Designs to respect the terms of the GPL. And until the matter has
been resolved XviD development will not continue.

That being said I hope all the forum members who saw their threads about
the Sigma Codecs being closed will understand our motivation now.
Internally we already knew what was going on but since the XviD authors
first wanted to try and resolve this internally we respected their wishes
and kept quiet about the matter at hand.

[Update] Sigma has issued a press release announcing the availability of
the source code of their MPEG-4 codec and it's already up for download.
However, not a word was lost about the XviD issue and the press release
makes one think that the Sigma codec was entirely developed by Sigma so we
might be hearing more about this.

[Update] I found a GPL notice in some of the source code files, but it
also looks like Sigma placed their own copyright lines there and XviD
doesn't get any credit in the source either. The GPL notice also collides
with Sigma's Software Licensing Agreement that you have to sign before
downloading codec or source. On on the same issue DivXNetworks said they'd
fully support XviD in this issue and apparently DXn's relationship with
Sigma didn't really work out either, as Sigma's Xcard is not as DivX
compatible as it was advertised.

[Update]First an update on the XviD situation. The release of the Sigma
source code does not mean it's all over, it's far from being over. The
license agreement which you have to agree to before you can download, and
install the codec is not compatible with the GPL. Furthermore, it can now
clearly be seen (download the source code and have a look for yourself)
that the Sigma codec is pretty much a copy of the XviD codec, but all the
copyright notices of the original developers have been removed and
replaced. This does not only violate the GPL but copyright laws - you
can't just take a program, change a few lines and change the copyright
statements, you only have copyright protection for the parts you wrote on
your own. And related to this the Sigma codec also contains code taken
from the OpenDivX project, the files were outfitted with 2 different
copyright notices which is quite funny.""

"back from my posting about FogBUGZ Setup fell into four
    categories. *","URL: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/news/20021008.html
Date: Not supplied

Feedback from my posting[1] about FogBUGZ[2] Setup fell into four categories. 

*""Why make Setup reversable? Instead you should collect all the information 
from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end.""* There are a 
couple of things to understand here. First of all, even if you do everything in 
one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle 
of the batch will fail, and in that case, a well-behaved setup program will 
back out the steps that were already done. There are well over 100 error 
messages in the string table for FogBUGZ Setup so the number of things that can 
fail is not insignificant. 

Second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages 
after they made the mistake. For example, early in the FogBUGZ setup process we 
prompt you to create an account for FogBUGZ to use: 

[IMG: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/pictures/setupNewAcct.gif (FogBUGZ Setup 
Screenshot)] 

The account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be 
predicted before trying to create the account. For example, the password might 
not conform to the system password policy. And different national versions of 
Windows NT have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha 
didn't know that!). It's better to tell the user about this problem right away 
so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the 
long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. And even if 
you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part 
of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left 
their system in an indeterminate state. 

In any case I need to write code to create the account and delete the account 
in case something later fails; I might as well call that code on this page of 
the wizard where I can display a useful error message. 

And what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? Well, in order to 
upgrade FogBUGZ without requiring a reboot (and we _never, ever _require a 
reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been 
keeping FogBUGZ files pinned down, such as IIS (Microsoft's web server). So 
part one of the batch is ""Stop IIS."" Now if part 2 fails for some reason, it 
would be _extremely_ rude to leave IIS not running. And anyway, it's not like I 
don't need to write the code for ""Start IIS"" for the end of the batch. So the 
code to rollback ""Stop IIS"" is already written. No big deal, I just need to 
call it at the right place. 

I think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then 
do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very 
slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. Indeed even 
FogBUGZ setup does 95% of its work at the very end. But the ""create account"" 
operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. Even our 95% of 
the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for 
IIS to stop and start. 

*""Why did you use VC++/MFC? Surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself 
has admitted by now that Delphi[3] is more productive.""* First of all, leave 
your language religious fanaticism at the Usenet door. Somehow I managed 
to figure out_ in high school_ that language advocacy and religious 
arguments are unbelievably boring.  

Secondly, even if Delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, 
since I am writing the code, is _what is more productive for Joel Spolsky_. And 
I don't know Delphi at all, but I know Win32, MFC, and VC++ _really, really 
well_. So while I might not outcode a good Delphi programmer, I would 
definitely outcode a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer (which is me), 
certainly over a short 4 week project. Third, many of the things I needed to do 
in this setup program are things like ""grant the Logon as Service privilege to 
an account."" This is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this 
is to search the Microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. When you 
search the web in general for how to do fancy things with Windows NT, what you 
find is about 75% C code, maybe 20% VB code, and 5% everything else. Yes, I 
know, I could translate the C code into Delphi (assuming I was a sophisticated 
Delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced Delphi programmer), but that 
costs as much productivity as I would supposedly gain from your supposedly more 
productive programming language. And fourth, I already had about 30% of the 
code I needed for Setup in MFC format: from FogBUGZ 2.0 Setup, and a library 
I've been using for years to make wizards. 

*""Why make Setup at all? You already have your customers' money. Good Setup 
programs don't increase sales.""* This was actually the smartest question and 
made me think the hardest. I came up with three reasons: 

- Decreased tech support cost. This setup program will pay for itself over the 
life of the code. 
- Delight my customers. When I'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, I want 
them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate 
because they are afraid to upgrade. I'm still using an old version of 
SpamAssassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though I know the 
new version is much better, because I just can't bear the thought of another 
morning wasted. The very memory of the first SpamAssassin installation -- all 
the little SSH windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and 
Google Groups, accidentally hitting Ctrl+Z in Emacs to undo and having it 
suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the MTA to run procmail, sorry it's 
too much. If SpamAssassin was making money off of upgraders they would have 
lost my business because they don't have a SETUP program. 
- Win reviews. Software reviewers always cast about for some kind of 
standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and 
oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. They always have a 
meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to PC games, 
mainframe databases, web site auction software, and DNA sequencing 
software. And Setup is always on their list. A single flaw in setup is 
guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it 
and say ""Aha!""

Getting your own domain needn't be expensive, looks more professional, and
you're not going to suddenly lose your site with little or no notice (yes,

I'm not sure what you mean by ""let's you and him fight"", but it is 
important to remember that England was in control of Ireland
for 300 years, and that it was only thanks to the distraction of WW I 
that the south managed to gain its independence. If you mean
splitting countries upon arbitrary lines and assigning different groups 
to opposite sides of the line, it also seems to have not worked in
India/Pakistan.
I suppose Canada, which is supposed to be a ""loose confederation"" of 2 
founding nations (French and English) can be cited as a success. The 
jury is still out, but so far only a few brief rebellions and 
referendums and such, still together after 130+ years.

Ah. In that case, you can use something considerably less powerful than 
VMWare. All you need is a machine configured to boot from CD-ROM and use 
a RAM disk for scratch space. Numerous Linux distros are available that 
let you boot a stateless but functional system from CD-ROM.

... but if you *do* want some state to persist, then you need a 
mountable writable partition. To protect it, you need some kind of 
access control management to decide who can do what to the writable 
partition, blah blah blah ... and before you know it, the security 
problem starts to look just like it does for conventional servers.

Simple approxmation to this: make /usr a separate partion, and mount it 
read-only:

    * The good news: attackers that want to trojan your software have to
      reboot, at least.
    * The bad news: administrators that want to update your software
      have to reboot, at least.

But some plonker will come up with yet another computer model
predicting global warming and storms and floods in 50 years even
though it can't predict next week's weather.  And predict widespread
cooling in some parts of the globe (which is now part of global
""warming"").  And will get plenty of publicity for even more conclusive
scaremong^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H^H proof.

Umpteen studies have already shown that temperature variations, when
even detectable in the noise, go either way depending on which data
you look at.

One study from Vienna showed long-term warming from thermometers at
the airport, and none from other sites.  Another study with data from
Antarctica which was touted as supporting global warming while being
free from this urbanization effect later turned out to be dominated by
the time of day at which the airplane that made the measurements flew

a Bush's 419 letter,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85486499
Date: Not supplied

A new addition to the parodical genre of 419 (""Nigerian Money Laundry Scam"") 
letters from members of the Shrub establishment, following up on Cheney's 
letter[1]. 

    I am the widow of the late President George W. Bush of the United States of 
    America. I am writing you this letter in confidence regarding my current 
    circumstances. 

    I escaped the United States ahead of death squads with my husband and two 
    children Jenna and Frank, moving first to England and then, when my 
    husband's political enemies took power there, to Austria. All of our 
    wealth, obtained legitimately through baseball, oil drilling and insider 
    trading, was seized by the new government of the USA under the despotic 
    regime of (Dr.) Noam Chomsky, except for the contents of a few Swiss bank 
    accounts. These bank accounts, which contain social security lock-box funds 
    and the bulk of the 2001 budget surplus, could not be accessed by me or my 
    children, due to agreements made between the socialist government of the 
    USA and Swiss bank regulators. They seized our ranch in Crawford, Texas and 
    now use it to teach homosexualist propaganda to schoolchildren.

zteana] Lincs lizard,"http://yorkshirepost.co.uk/scripts/editorial2.cgi?cid=news&aid=481687

2.5ft lizard 'abandoned' at resort

Holidaymakers at a seaside resort were stunned to find a 2.5ft lizard
sunning itself at a caravan park close to a beach.
The savannah monitor lizard was captured at Chapel St Leonards, Lincs, on
Sunday by a member of the public before being collected by an RSPCA team.
RSPCA officer Justin Stubbs, who took the lizard to a specialist carer,
said: ""Savannah monitors can give a nasty bite and we certainly wouldn't
have wanted one loose in a busy holiday resort for long.""
Officials believe the animal may have been abandoned by a private owner
because it has not been reported missing.
Savannah monitor lizards originate in Africa and are carnivorous, eating
rats and small rodents. They can grow to 4ft in length.
Anyone with information about the lizard can contact the RSPCA in confidence
on 08705 555 999.

spamc will skip every file bigger than 250k on it's own. It's got the 
command line switch -s to change this value. But it doesn't hurt of course 
to use the procmail limit.

The CDs will probably cost less than 7.5 million to produce and

G] VPN implementation,"I need to setup a VPN between a few sites. From what I've read, the the
choices come down (on the Linux side) to IPsec (using FreeSWAN) or CIPE.
It seems that FreeSWAN is 'better', being an implementation of IPsec which
is a standard. However, CIPE does the job as well for Linux clients and is
somewhat simpler to setup. 

The problem is that it's not a pure Linux situation - a couple of the sites
run OS-X. I'm pretty sure that I'll be able to find an implementation of
IPsec for OS-X, but I think CIPE is Linux only.

So, the question is for those of you have have implemented BOTH - is there a
significant difference in setup time and hassle between CIPE and FreeSWAN ?
If CIPE is going to be much easier than dealing with FreeSWAN (and whatever
on the OS-X sites) then I'll simply get a Linux box for each of the remote
sites - with the low price of hardware, it doesn't take much more complexity
in software to make buying hardware to use simpler software economic.

question that started this whole project, ""what is the RDF in RSS 1.0 good 
for?"" is two things: it's good for someone who has an infinitely large database 
that can be queried infinitely fast by a schema-aware program, or it's good for 
writing a schema-aware aggregator that can try to figure out what it should do 
with new elements that it hasn't seen before. That's actually an interesting 
project with some potential for success, but at this point I'm sick of the 
whole thing, so I'll leave that project for someone else.&#8221;

As I'd written the code a few months ago, we were reading the sequences file 
first to see what sequences were in it and then once per sequence.  This 
happens anywhere that we look at sequences, most notably in Ftoc_ShowSequences.
That seemed to be an obvious lose performancewise, but I wanted my abstraction to 
have a separate call for ""what sequences are in this folder?"" and ""what 
messages are in this sequence?"".  One option would have been to add another 
call to get the data off of disk, but I felt that the check-the-modify-time 
technique would be less error-prone.

I think the biggest gains would be from augmenting Ftoc_ShowSequences to allow 
a finer specification of what needs to be updated in the ftoc so that the 
current code would only be run when we really do have to update all sequences 
for all messages.  I described these thoughts in an email message yesterday.

And again, if it can wait a few weeks, I'm willing to do it.

Sure it is - it tends to bring out the people who let ""hysterical

my hysterical left wing ""propaganda"" is generally an emotional
reaction on a mailing list, not an organizaed attempt at converting

Well, I think until recently, support for most things on Linux was kind of
shady... Things have got much better... You're right in that the JDK used to
suck on Linux... But then, IMHO, Linux is still maturing.... or at least
development tools for Linux are maturing... I've been developing a few
server side apps that run on Linux recently with JDK 1.3.x and they've had
no problems with great performance.

Hmmm... Do you really think that MS is pulling out Java because it's a ""Bad""
programming language or application platform?  You don't think this has
anything to do with .NET being a competitor to Java do you?  Or that MS has
basically copied Java (with some additional features) and called it C#?
Isn't that alone an indication that they actually DO think that a VM is the
right way to go for most high level applications?

Hmmm again.... You're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took
you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak?  I am
not the best C/C++ programmer... not even close... But I've known really
good ones... and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory
management, however occasional they may be.

Wow!  So you're telling me that unless the application involves
bit-counting, it's trivial?  What about the application itself?  What about
high level problems such as task distribution, work-flow, etc.?  Aren't most
high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns?
Or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal C/C++ code?  For
example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks
(there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating
system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment?

I can see how you could infer this. However, what I believe to really be the
case is that Java is one of the best languages for writing large
applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more
than three programmers.  In those cases, it's always very hard to get the
programmers to agree on API's, memory management techniques, etc.  With
Java, the JCP takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in
a long meeting trying to decide what API to use to hook up to a database
(JDBC) or a messaging bus (JMS).

ODBC?

So, are you saying that there is a standard set of API's for C/C++ for
everything? (aside to the minimal ANSI stuff).  Is there a standard way of
dealing with C/C++ applications for various domain problems (messaging,
database persistence, etc.) that rivals Java?  I'd like to know if there is

tend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and

than in Java due to existence of standard API's.

And further, why focus on the fact they were laid off and not on the
fact they were hired in the first place?

BTW: I saw someone claim that aside from the efficiency of the market
there were also gains to society from irrational behavior.

If a society has business people that systematically overestimate their
chances, that is bad for the businessmen but on net a big gain for
society.  On the social level, the law of averages works to societies
benefit in a manner it can't for an individual.

A key reason, in this view, that the US wound up outperforming England
was that the English investors were too rational for their societies own
good.

(Except, of course, when US investors were bilking them to build canals
and railroads over here.  Thanks, guys.)

Hmm. Seems like every CD player should include the
capability to rip, encode, and cache the last few CDs 
inserted. 

Playback would then never need to face seek delays... 
after the initial ripping, the only use of the laser 
pickup would be recognizing which CD is inserted --
which might be doable faster than a seek-and-start-at-
first-track operation.

You could also take the CD out while it is ""playing"".

Hmm. If the CD is still in the cache, maybe you don't
even have to insert it. Or choose it from a step-through
UI. Instead, you just wave it at an electronic eye of
some sort... and the player recognizes it from the 
silkscreening. Kids would like that. ""Play this,"" they'd
say, facing the CD at the player, and the player would
start immediately.

programming languages are defended on the basis of analogies with structural engineering, as presented in

The Value of Analogies

Programming language design is a comparatively new activity - it has existed for less than half a century, so
it is
often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity. Thus, my book
Principles of Programming Languages: Design, Evaluation, and Implementation, grew out of a study of teaching
methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design.
Perhaps you
have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (FORTRAN = Model T, C = dune
buggy, etc.). 

These analogies can be very informative, and can serve as ``intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but
they
cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. Ultimately our design decisions must
be
based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. 

In this essay I'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but I will base my remarks
on a
book about structural engineering, The Tower and the Bridge, by David P. Billington. Although there are many
differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer
rather
directly. 

According to Billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call
``the
three E's'': Efficiency, Economy and Elegance. These values correspond to three dimensions of technology,
which
Billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three S's). We will consider each in
turn. 


Efficiency Seeks to Minimize Resources Used

In structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used; the basic criterion is safety
and the
issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). Similarly, in programming language
design,
efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. There are many examples where
efficiency
considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my Principles of Programming
Languages). In the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing
time, although compile-time resource utilization was also relevant. In other cases the resource economized was
programmer typing time, and there are well-known cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. FORTRAN's
implicit declarations). There are also many well-known cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed
for the
sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). 

Efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we
are
not comparing apples and oranges. Compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as
programmer time. Similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are
reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now
turn. 


Economy Seeks to Maximize Benefit versus Cost

Whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. In structural engineering, economy seeks
to
maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (This is especially appropriate since structures like bridges
are
usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) In programming language design, the ``public''
that
must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these
programmers work. 

Economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. For example,
the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost
of
computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the
increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of
program
maintenance compared to program development. 

Other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include: whether major
manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some
way
by influential organizations (such as the US Department of Defense), whether it has been standardized, whether
it
comes to be perceived as a ``real'' language (used by ``real programmers'') or as a ``toy'' language (used by
novices
or dilettantes), and so forth. As can be seen from the historical remarks in my Principles, social factors are
frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming
language. 

Often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are
often
unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. Also, many social issues, from
dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately
represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. All kinds of ``cost'' and ``benefit'' must be considered
in
seeking an economical design. 


Elegance Symbolizes Good Design

``Elegance? Who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hard-nosed engineer, but Billington shows clearly the
critical
role of elegance in ``hard-nosed'' engineering. 

For the Designer

It is well-known that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the
difficulty
of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my Principles for examples).
Structural
engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but Billington observes that the best designers don't
make
extensive use of computer models and calculation. 

One reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. The engineer must make a decision about which
variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this
decision is not
made well. Also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this
is
another potential source of error. Because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical
analysis
may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. Thus the price of
safety is
additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). 

Similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a
choice between an under-engineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an
over-engineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. 

Many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the four-month-old Tacoma Narrows bridge; it
vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design.
Billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a
consequence of
an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. However, the very problem that destroyed
the
Tacoma Narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided
by aesthetic principles. 

According to Billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do
not
abandon it altogether). Rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. This is because
solutions to
structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible
solutions to a
particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. Therefore, expert designers restrict their attention
to
designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. The design looks unbalanced if the forces are
unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. 

The general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can
be
guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. Billington expresses this idea
by
inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. He adds
(p.
21), ``When the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' In other words, the choice of
form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and
economical design). If we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. 

The same applies to programming language design. By restricting our attention to designs in which the
interaction
of features is manifest - in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad - we can let our
aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having
to
check all the possible interactions. 

For the User

In this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. Nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge
that
looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which
features may ``explode'' if combined in the wrong way. The manifest balance of forces in a well-designed
bridge
gives us confidence when we cross it. So also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should
reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (well-justified) confidence in the
consequences
of our actions. 

We accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. When the bridge is unable to
sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the
outside.
So also in programming languages. If the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation
of a
deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their
(unwarranted)
confidence. 

In summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. As a
consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or
programming languages) they design. We may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited
value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. We may summarize the
preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my Principles of Programming Languages: 
                                The Elegance Principle

              Confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. 



The Programming Language as Work Environment

There are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a well-engineered programming language. The programming
language is something the professional programmer will live with - even live in. It should feel comfortable
and
safe, like a well-designed home or office; in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that
take
place within it. Would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? 

A programming language should be a joy to use. This will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's
fatigue
and frustration. The programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator,
encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. As some automobiles are ``driving machines'' and work as a
natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a ``programming machine'' by encouraging
the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. The programming
language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. 

Through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. For example, in the variety of
its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism; the kind of its features may
represent intellectual sophistication, down-to-earth practicality or ignorant crudeness. Thus a programming
language can promote a set of values. By embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them; by
neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention.
Out of
sight, out of mind. 


Acquiring a Sense of Elegance

Aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined
sense
of elegance necessary to good design. Billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive
experience
in design, which, especially in Europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers.
Because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each
competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. The public
also
critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated; their sense of elegance develops along
with that of the designers. 

So also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages - design obsessively -
and criticize, revise and discard your designs. You should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs
and try
to improve them. In this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the ``real thing''
comes
along.

The gist of the call was that since we were using razor and checking our

information proprietary to Cloudmark, we would [in the near future?] be
required to begin paying Cloudmark/spamnet $1.00/user per year. I was
wondering if anyone else has received such a call?

I am curious as to whether a spammer has begun to try contacting razor users
with the above tactic in an effort to get them to stop using razor or
whether the open source/community aspect of the razor project is going by

"the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its
    hazards (fwd)","Hi Kragen,

   This is an interesting analysis.  I think that there are a couple
of nits I might pick (for example, I don't expect that the market will
be well developed with highest bidders for while), I think that the
most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix
their systems, is almost passed over.  I know that you know this, and
you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you
might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others.

   There's one other point which you don't make, which I think is very
important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes
of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available
vulnerability code.  I can think of three researchers into automated
methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about
the quality of the existing vulnerability sites.  Doing research into
a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you
can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so
you can make and test predictions.

   I feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we
wouldn't have Stackguard, ITS4, Nissus, or snort.  And the security
admin's job would be a lot harder.

| Subject: the underground software vulnerability marketplace and its hazards
| 
| On August 7th, an entity known as ""iDEFENSE"" sent out an announcement,
| which is appended to this email.  Briefly, ""iDEFENSE"", which bills
| itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash
| for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software
| that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell
| anyone else.
| 
| If this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a
| very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.
| 
| At the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research
| known as ""full disclosure""; people who discover security
| vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short
| while later --- after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem
| --- they publish the information, including code to exploit the
| vulnerability, if possible.  
| 
| This method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by
| CERT in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible
| disclosure"" --- never release working exploit code, and never release
| any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released
| a patch.  This procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers
| vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked
| on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people
| wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem
| was.
| 
| The underground computer criminal community would often discover and
| exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible
| disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the
| underground, vulnerable.
| 
| The problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known
| are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to
| reduce their potential impact --- including disabling software,
| turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and
| detecting and responding to intrusions.  They are therefore much less
| useful to would-be intruders.  Also, software companies usually see
| security vulnerabilities in their software as PR problems, and so
| prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as
| long as possible.
| 
| iDEFENSE is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous
| than either of the two previous paradigms.  They want to be a buyer in
| a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding
| discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.  
| 
| Not long before, Snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently
| including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the
| secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software
| vendor; specifically, they apparently made a private offer to
| Hewlett-Packard to keep a vulnerability in HP's Tru64 Unix secret if
| HP retained Snosoft's ""consulting services"".  HP considered this
| extortion and responded with legal threats, and Snosoft published the
| information.
| 
| If this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,
| together, add up to a catastrophe.
| 
| First, secret software vulnerability information will be available to
| the highest bidder, and to nobody else.  For reasons explained later,
| I think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime
| syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.
| 
| Second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will
| become lucrative for many more talented people.  The result will be
| --- just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days --- that the good
| guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority
| of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.
| 
| I've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the
| vendors of the vulnerable software, but I don't think that's
| plausible.  If someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets
| them, the software vendor is never held liable; often, in fact, the
| people who administer the software aren't liable, either --- when
| credit card data are stolen from an e-commerce site, for example.
| Knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a web-site
| administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some
| negative PR, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.
| 
| I think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability
| information is most lucrative --- the thieves who can use it to
| execute the largest heists without getting caught.  Inevitably, that
| means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who
| are good at networked theft may not yet exist.
| 
| There might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as
| Microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad PR
| than a gang could make by theft.  Think of a remote-root hole in
| Samba, for example.
| 
| Right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either
| motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public
| interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or
| personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits.  Creating
| a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly
| increase the availability of that information to the people who can
| afford to pay the most for it: spies, terrorists, and organized crime.
| 
| Let's not let that happen.

| Subject: Introducing iDEFENSE's Vulnerability Contributor Program
| 
| 
| Greetings,
| 
| iDEFENSE is pleased to announce the official launch of its Vulnerability
| Contributor Program (VCP). The VCP pays contributors for the advance
| notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.
| 
| iDEFENSE hopes you might consider contributing to the VCP. The following
| provides answers to some basic questions about the program:
| 
| Q. How will it work?
| A. iDEFENSE understands the majority of security researchers do not publish
| security research for compensation; rather, it could be for any of a number
| of motivations, including the following:
| 
|          * Pure love of security research
|          * The desire to protect against harm to targeted networks
|          * The desire to urge vendors to fix their products
|          * The publicity that often accompanies disclosure
| 
| The VCP is for those who want to have their research made public to the
| Internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the
| work.The compensation will depend, among other things, on the following
| items:
| 
|          * The kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)
|          * The amount of detail and analysis provided
|          * The potential severity level for the information shared
|          * The types of applications, operating systems, and other
|            software and hardware potentially affected
|          * Verification by iDEFENSE Labs
|          * The level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to iDEFENSE
| 
| Q. Who should contribute to the VCP?
| A. The VCP is open to any individual, security research group or other
| entity.
| 
| Q. Why are you launching this program?
| A. Timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. Contributions
| to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. More
| often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the
| original contributor. Under the iDEFENSE program, the contributor is
| compensated, iDEFENSE Labs verifies the issue, and iDEFENSE clients and the
| public at large are warned in a timely manner.
| 
| Q. Who gets the credit?
| A. The contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or
| exploit information.
| 
| Q. When can I contribute?
| The VCP is active. You are welcome to begin contributing today.
| 
| To learn more, go to http://www.idefense.com/contributor.html. If you have
| questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the VCP, please
| contact us at contributor@idefense.com.

So did my build if the original source is what you were mentioning ;-)
One drawback : They changed from pspell to aspell apparently, and it
requires aspell >= 0.50 which isn't even in Rawhide, so spell checking is
disabled for now until I take a decision about it :-/

If I build recent aspell packages, they may not be upgraded when ungrating
to the next Red Hat Linux release (the final version of the limbos and
(null) betas), which is maybe not really desired. I'll probably test and
see...

Given current trends, particularly in demographics, such conflict won't
be military.  Europe wouldn't stand a chance now and things are getting
worse in a hurry.  They are SOL.

Not to mention that when push comes to shove they wouldn't stand united.

That idea looks good although it maybe needs to be tweaked a bit more (what
you sent doesn't support packages named ""kernel-smp""). I'd also prefer a
cleaner way than the env variable, and preferrably not editing the spec...
probably ""--define 'target 2.4.xx-xx' --with smp"". Sound good enough?
The BuildRequires on ""kernel-source"" will also need to be removed because
it won't necessarily need to be true, and that does bug me a bit :-/

More ideas are welcome.

Flist_FindUnseen has changed to Flist_FindSeqs.  It takes the same arguments,

zteana] Lioness adopts fifth antelope,"http://www.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,3604,806579,00.html

Lioness adopts fifth antelope

Rory Carroll, Africa correspondent
Tuesday October 8, 2002
The Guardian

Kamuniak the dysfunctional lioness has forfeited another meal by adopting
her fifth baby oryx this year, an aberration of nature which has baffled
wildlife experts.
The young lioness in the Samburu national park in northern Kenay adopted her
latest baby at the weekend, a wildlife service warden said yesterday.
Each time Kamuniak, whose name means ""the blessed one"" in the local Samburu
tongue, has tried to protect the antelopes from other predators and allowed
the natural mothers to feed them.
Unfortunately for her, one oryx ended up in the belly of a male lion while
Kamuniak slept; the others were either rescued by wardens or retrieved by
their natural mothers.
The wardens think the latest adoptee, nicknamed Naisimari (""taken by
force""), was adopted at the weekend.
""She must have adopted her on Sunday because they are in harmony,"" said
Gabriel Lepariyo, a warden.
Naisimari's natural mother has been seen shadowing the odd couple at a
distance.
Theories to explain the phenonemon abound: not having her own cubs, Kamuniak
is lonely; she is colour-blind and short-sighted and thinks the calves are
cubs; the oryx were too frail to flee, breaking the classic prey behaviour
and confusing the hunter; Kamuniak wants to be a vegetarian; Kamuniak wants
to be loved.

I'd suggest using Precedence: junk. Albeit it's no standard header does most 
Software already recognize it. Courier eg. doesn't send auto-replies to 
mails with the Precedence bulk or junk. I think Outlook does handle these 
special, too. [1] says:

Bob,

This guy's an idiot.

I design loads for systems with the 50 kV capacitors.  One of those has 864
of such capacitors and stores only 10 megajoules, which means 11 kilojoules
each.  They weigh 125 kg.

You need high energy per unit mass, and the capacitive system I picked
maximizes that.

It is precisely the system that Maxwell is touting for electrical braking
and power augmentation for regenerative use in automobiles.  You also need
voltage you can use in a DC motor, which is why though the actual
capacitors in the system are charged to 2.5 volts, the system has them
arranged in series to boost the voltage.

Ignore him.  He's a waste of my time.

Since the energy you can pack into a capacitor is something like
1/2*C*(V^2), you want to design your system with the lowest voltage possible
to fully exploit that V^2 ;) So yea, a 42V system will only be useful for
accelerating insects, not cars. That must be why 40kV is standard not 42.
(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed BTW)

Most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few
real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were
talking about originally. Even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the
wrong choice"" limits. Thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one,
it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady
discharge curve.

But it should be safe to say that most people want the Indy 500 version, not
the 1/4 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice :) For those
you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole
atoms, not just electrons. Then you can suck off the electrons you need with
a fuel cell. However, you will use both capacitors for the braking/accel,
and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.

This step is unneccesary -- unless you've changed the scripts 
much, any test in the logs which aren't in the rules files will 
just be ignored I think.  You do seem to have changed the 
logs-to-c script and removed the bit where you could specify 
immutable tests at the top -- I took a brief glance through the 
code and couldn't fully make out how it had changed.  I think we 
want to be able to specify immutable test scores though in there 
somewhere -- or is that now handled by the tflags stuff?  For 
the last couple releases, any test which occurred infrequently 
(by thumb-in-the-wind subjective criteria) I set to have 
immutable scores, as well as a handful of other rules.

No, but using PickMarkSeen (and pick(ids)) as an alternative to
just doing

	Seq_Del $exmh(folder) $mhProfile(unseen-sequence) $results

seems unnecessary to me (that's all that PickMarkSeen does after all).
(That can be done via ""busy"")

Of course, the same is true of the badly named Pick_MarkSeen which has
nothing at all to do with ""pick"" except that it (ab)uses the pick(ids) var
in the same way.   (Its name would be hard to change unfortunately, as it
is known in app-defaults files for the ""Catch Up Unseen"" menu item, but
its implementation could certainly be fixed).

	As Hal noted, I like to have the unseen window visible in all
virtual desktops, even if the main window is minimized. However, I looked
through ALL the preferences menus, and didn't see anything resembling ""Show
unseen message count in folder cache"". Where is that? And in what version?
(I'm running v2.4 - 06/23/2000 - Creaky, I know.)

	I went into twm with no virtual desktops, and it came up just fine.
Going back to Enlightenment I saw the same behavior as before. Then I knew
it MUST be something in the window manager, so I went digging. in my 
~/.englightenment/...e_session-XXXXXX.snapshots.0 file I found all the
settings that E. uses for remembering border styles, positions, shaded
state, etc. 
	I have a 1600x1200 screen, and it kept putting my window at
1655x150 (AND had it shaded to boot, so it was tiny as well as offscreen!)
	Searching for 'unseen' in that file found this section:

NEW: exmh.Exmh
NAME: exmh
CLASS: Exmh
NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
NAME: unseen
CLASS: UnseenWin
DESKTOP: 0
RES: 1600 1200
WH: 114 173
XY: 1655 150 0 0
LAYER: 4
STICKY: 1
SKIPTASK: 0
SKIPWINLIST: 0
SKIPFOCUS: 0
SHADE: 2
BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE

	I changed:
XY: 1655 150 0 0  	to 
XY: 1455 150 0 0	so it would reappear in my viewable space,
restarted Enlightenment (CTRL-ALT-End) and then restarted exmh. Bingo!
There was my window! 

	I quickly told Englightenment to forget everything about that
window except is border style, and now have a sveldt little entry like so:

NEW: exmh.Exmh
NAME: exmh
CLASS: Exmh
NEW: unseen.UnseenWin
NAME: unseen
CLASS: UnseenWin
BORDER: PAGER_LEFT_BLUE

	Completely an Enlightenment problem, not exmh. (Though I wonder how
it got mixed up in the first place? I certainly can't move a window off
screen like that. Unless it was part way over then snapped offscreen when
shading.)

	Hmm. Weird. 

	Anyway, thanks for the suggestions, folks. Hopefully this will be
useful to someone scouting the archives in the future... :-)

I'd say that the file apt downloaded is corrupted. Maybe trying ""apt-get

It places the company, corporate network and data at risk.

Outlook is subject to an (absurdly large) number of exploits with more
being regularly found.  An exploited system, to whatever extent, places
other corporate systems at risk, customer systems at risk, company
reputation and liability with customers at risk, and
proprietary/corporate data at risk.  Further, users cannot be reliably
expected to use Outlook in a safe manner.  The net result is that
Outlook use is considered to be somewhere between criminal negligence
and deliberately malicious as far as the employer is concerned.

I don't use custom sequences, so I can't comment well.  I suspect that
you'd have to use a cron job to maintain the sequences.

Nope.  I run exmh on my desktops at home and at work with the resulting
exmh windows being displayed on both my work and home desktops (gratis

(this message) while at work, using an exmh instance running on my home

for the wifi net. I got a linksys BEFW11S4(1) for the router/hub/wireless
ap/firewall/etc and a linksys wifi pcmcia card for the laptop

I made one false move so it took about 30 mins all told to set up the
card, the router, and the other 3 machines in the house on the wire ether
hub. All vfery neat very easy and very very cool set up via the
webinterface. I have to dig into the firewall/nat/routing features some
more (i have been reading up the wifi security blackpaper on ars technica)
but all in all a smooth move.


Now the place im at now, the house soon to be the ex house, has lots of
funky things going on in the walls and in the area. We are in ,
essentialy, a gravel pit..recption of all types suck and transmisions get
goofy inside the pit.  That being said... with 2 walls and 40 feet between
the AP and the pcmica card (no external antena on it) Im still getting
11mbs and at least 60% goodness.


Some cool things about the new house...its a 1912 job so no metal works
inthe walls to speak of , mostly wood and plaster. We dont have a
microwave and our cordless phines are on 900mhz (yea so I can use my bear
cat to listen in on some calls, with kids in the house is that such a bad
thing? Ben or heather, if you read this years from now...well by then I
hope youare better at countermoeasures:)- )

Ok, enough testing for tonight. I gota say, being able to do this in bed
by vncing via wifi to my desktop is a blast...oh no...wifes pillow is
heading this way....DUCKKKKK

Rendering polygons is not as easy as it used to be, the reason being the vast 
amount of different rendering techniques, methods and algorithms available. Not 
only is choosing the right ones a problem, even worse, all that are selected 
need to work together. There are some algorithms which simply do not work 
together, and in that case, only one may be used whilt the other one needs to 
be replaced witha more compatible method. This feature explores how Factor 5 
approached the problem when developing Rogue Leader for Gamecube.

A)  Which religion is it that can claim no foul actions in its past? 
 Certainly not Christianity, Islam, etc.
B) ""How it is currently being expressed"" amounts to a tacit 
acknowledgement that the sophistication of the society involved and 
people's self-limiting reasonableness are important to avoid primitive 
expression.  This leads to the point that religion and less 
sophisticated societies are a dangerous mix.  It also tends to invoke 
the image of extremes that might occur without diligent maintenance of 
society.
C) Many splinter Christianity religions have 'clean hands' but they also 
aren't 'found in the wild'.

(By ""primitive expression"", I don't mean to slight any society, but that 
there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized 
behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). 
 The US has only really been mostly free of ""primitive expression"" for 
40-50 years, although large categories, including serious religious 
conflict, were settled quite a while ago.)

D) The Northern Ireland Protestant vs. Catholic feud, recently more or 
less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated 
by splitting society too much along religious lines.  One Post article 
pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical 
integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, 
government, political party, etc.  (Of course both cases have a heritage 
of British conquest, but who doesn't?)

(I couldn't find the article I remember, but here are a couple of others:)

'Northern Ireland is a British province of green valleys and 
cloud-covered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and 
religiously divided. About 54 percent of the population is Protestant, 
and most Protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part 
of Britain. The Roman Catholic minority is predominantly republican, or 
nationalist; they want to merge with the Republic of Ireland to the south.


In 1968, Catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s campaign in the American South. But 
violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling 
the political argument. Armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both 
sides. Police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by 
far was the IRA, fighting on the Catholic side with a goal of a united 
Ireland

The provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were 
killed during the 30-year conflict known, with characteristic Northern 
Ireland understatement, as ""The Troubles.""'

zteana] Big cats 'on the increase',"http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2220922.stm


Big cats are on the loose in Britain and breeding their way towards record
numbers, a monitoring group has claimed. 
The British Big Cats Society said it has received more than 800 reports of
animals including pumas, black panthers, leopards and so-called Fen tigers
over the past 12 months. 

And while it admits that many sightings are of nothing more exotic than the
average moggy, it claims to have ""firm evidence"" that the majority are real.


Society founder Daniel Bamping told BBC News Online he could cope with the
critics and doubters, adding: ""I was a sceptic, I thought it was in the same
realm as the Loch Ness monster. 

""But it's not, they are really out there."" 

'Cats with cubs' 

Mr Bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the
country. 

Big cat reports  
Hotspots include Scotland and Gloucestershire 
January 2002 - Kent man clawed by suspected Lynx 
November 2001 - farmer reports animals mauled by big cat 
April 2001 - Lynx captured in north London 
1999 - Puma-like cat attacks horse in Wales  
""This weekend alone I have had sightings from Wales, the Scottish borders,
Kent, the West Midlands, Devon, Somerset and Wiltshire,"" he said. 

The society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. 

But Mr Bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in
sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. 

""We have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 

'Trigger camera' 

The society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including
photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. 

But it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public
that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. 

A national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes,
will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. 

Mr Bamping said: ""The idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and
take a picture of itself."" 

'Like dogs' 

The society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the
wild, or their descendants. 

Its spokesman Danny Nineham said: ""In the 1960s and 1970s, people had big
cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. 

""But in 1976 when the Dangerous Wild Animals Act came into force, people
released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them
down, or take them to a zoo.""

ged location of incoming mail. exmh not working!!,"I use exmh 2.5 with procmail for presorting incoming mail and move it to
the relevant folder using rcvstore.

Recently, my incoming mail (or spool) location moved to another disk.
I'm not quite clear how to reconfigure procmail/rcvstore/exmh to accept
mail from the new location.

There seems to be a variable in exmh-defaults (bgspool). It says at the
top of the file not to edit these lines. So, I went ahead and edited it :-)
That does not make a difference.

It seems like procmail is the one that is actually reading the mail from
my spool/incoming mail area and piping it to rcvstore. So, I need to
configure that probably.

Any idea how I would do this?

Thanks

It does, but it's not the cost that is causing us to shut it down. The cost
is a ""minimum $500 per year""... but that only accounts for 18 people
streaming and playing like 13 or 14 songs an hour. But we could maybe manage
the 2 cents per person, per 100 songs.

The problem comes with the record keeping they mandate with webstreaming.
Start and end times for every song (not too hard), artist (okay), title
(okay), composers (a little harder), serial number (wtf??). I think there
are a few more things they wanted, but honestly, programming this info in
for every song that we play is ridiculous. This means we'd also have to get
all the DJs to find this info and write it down any time they play a
request, vinyl, or CDs not loaded into the computer. It's ridiculous and
nearly impossible...

We would need someone to sit in the studio 24/7 writing down all this info -
which sometimes isn't available, like from earlier album that don't have
serial numbers and barcodes. Then still if only the magic 18 people
webstream our signal, the price would become quite exponential since we play
on average 16 songs an hour, we'd be paying $22.11 everyday to stream to
those 18 people. So really, it does have to do with the internet tax, but it
is a few reasons together why we can't do it after their kill-date. :(

My laptop has a Via C3 processor. I use Debian with a self-compiled
2.4.19 kernel, and have had absolutely no problems with the chip at all
(quite the opposite, in fact).

I had to compile for ""686"" in order for 3D acceleration to work (the
kernel has an option specifically for the Via C3), but I assume that was
a kernel problem rather than a hardware problem.

Don't worry too much about it, you seem to have plenty of other things
to do in the immediate future, and this one isn't so critical that people
can't use the code in normal ways.

But, to make it happen, type (with normal key bindings) any digit, so the
code thinks you're trying a message number, then backspace, so the digit
goes away, then '-' (other junk characters don't seem to have the
problem, I have just been playing).   That will do it (every time).

That is: 0 ^h -

Once you get into that state, the same traceback occurs for every
character you type, until a message is selected with the mouse.

This is looking like it might be easy to find and fix, so I'll take a
look at it later.

been aiming for, but the freaking RedHat Kernel srpms still have been stump 
...

	If we could get this and the alsa driver stuff working, it would be whole 
lot easier to try out a newer kernel ... but then the size of these rpms 
are huge, at least for us n^1 world courties ... ;-{ ...

	I will keep watching and hoping that somebody comes up with a great working

You need to install the ""glut"" package from Red Hat Linux 8.0 (and
""glut-devel"" if you intend to recompile the source rpm).

Here you need both ""aalib"" and ""lirc"" from freshrpms.net. They're small,
they can be quite useful, that's why I've compiled xine with them as a
default.
You should be able to get rid of those two though, by rebuilding the source
rpm (otherwise it's a bug in my packaging!) :
rpmbuild --rebuild --without aalib --without lirc xine*.src.rpm

Agreed, not much difference there. With C it just doesnt seem as wrong to
be crawling around in registers and things. Quite frankly you cant fit
_that_ big of a project into a 32K ROM, so large project issues dont matter
as much in the embedded world.

And in the realtime space, or when you have data coming in at 2Gbit/sec

Have done exactly this with debian, only I used a PCMCIA network card and
did it off ftp.esat.net (ucd bandwidth is rather good).

However, if you've another machine, look into this null modem cable jobby:

http://rosebud.sps.queensu.ca/~edd/t100cs.html

whether you can connect that to direct cable connectionI've no idea.  You
could however, put the files onto windows, boot onto a ILUG BBC[tm] and
mount the fat32 partition.

Easier/Quicker way is to get your hands on a PCMCIA nic.  Also makes the
maptop far more useful in the long run.

When I receive a message that has a line starting with ""From "", it's
broken into two messages.  I get my mail from /var/spool/mail.  The
program that incorporates mail thinks that the ""From "" line starts a new
message.

My sysadmins have told me that the sending mail client is supposed to 
escape lines begining with ""From "".  EXMH (2.5) doesn't do this.  Should 
it?  It appears that my MH is MH 6.8.  Does NMH fix this?

The people who pour the espresso aren't rich.  An interesting issue
might be how it affects employment.

Still, it is a 1% or less sales tax.  That might not make that big of a
difference.  

The costs of tracking revenue and collecting the tax might be onerous.
Worse than the cost of the tax itself.

Red Hat 8.0 ships with the bytecode hinter enabled; I think 7.3 may have 
as well.

The enabling change to ""ftoption.h"" is made by Red Hat's SRPM before 
building.  Take a look at ""freetype-2.1.1-enable-ft2-bci.patch"" from the 
SRPM; it's pretty clear that this does exactly what needs to be done.

So if your fonts look ugly, lack of bytecode hinting is *not* the cause.

mbayes] test sets?,"
I've got a test set here that's the last 3 and a bit years email to
info@ekit.com and info@ekno.com - it's a really ugly set of 20,000+
messages, currently broken into 7,000 spam, 9,000 ham, 9,000 currently
unclassified. These addresses are all over the 70-some different 
ekit/ekno/ISIConnect websites, so they get a LOT of spam.

As well as the usual spam, it also has customers complaining about 
credit card charges, it has people interested in the service and 
asking questions about long distance rates, &c &c &c. Lots and lots 
of ""commercial"" speech, in other words. Stuff that SA gets pretty 
badly wrong.

I'm currently mangling it by feeding all parts (text, html, whatever 
else :) into the filters, as well as both a selected number of headers 
(to, from, content-type, x-mailer), and also a list of 
(header,count_of_header). This is showing up some nice stuff - e.g. the 
X-uidl that stoopid spammers blindly copy into their messages.

I did have Received in there, but it's out for the moment, as it causes
rates to drop.

I'm also stripping out HTML tags, except for href="""" and src="""" - there's
so so much goodness in them (note that I'm only keeping the contents of
the attributes).

In my experience, this protest behavior is really only an issue in
""ultra-liberal"" coastal cities, which is where I normally live.  It is
part of the culture and that behavior is viewed as acceptable.  

For comparison, contrast this with the character of the arguably more
serious protests against Federal government abuse in the inter-mountain
West.  They have a very different idea of what constitutes acceptable
protest practice.  Those protests remain largely civil and polite, if
heated and aggressive, and those involve a far greater percentage of the
local population.  And unlike 99% of the liberal coastal city protests
I've seen, the people protesting in the inter-mountain West are actually
facing immediate dire consequences from the activities they are
protesting and are strongly motivated to protest in a manner that gets
results.  Some of their tactics, such as the practice of many businesses
and restaurants in northern Nevada to not give service to anyone known
to be in the employ of the BLM and related agencies, have been very
effective at forcing dialog.  I don't recall anyone characterizing their
protests as impolite, rude, or violent, but then they have more to lose.

I have folks who leave their email programs running 24 hours a day, constantly polling 
for mail. If they go away for a long weekend, lots of ""friday night spam"" will become 
ham on sunday night.  (Friday night seems to be the most popular time)

Ultimately I'd like to see tight integration into the ""most popular email clients"".. As a 
stop-gap to the auto-ham ..

How about adding an IMAP server with a spam and deleted-ham folder. Most email 
clients can handle IMAP. Users should be able to quickly move ""spam"" into the spam 
folder. 

Instead of deleting messages (or, by reprogramming the delete function) they can 
quickly move ham into the ham folder.

In either case, the message would be processed and then destroyed.

Alsa/Redhat 8 compatability,"Matthias Saou (matthias@rpmforge.net) wrote*:

I had been hand building those alsa packages for probably 6 months or more, so I
could use my laptop's ESS chip best (hard disk recording and such). Wow, maybe 8 to
10 months, time flys. I didn't look forward to doing that tedious build every time I
changed a kernel or something. Matthias has made this a thing of the past! Dude,
it's a no brainer, use apt-get or just download and install.

What's more, OSS is fully ""imitated"", older apps using OSS are as happy as a clam.
My personal taste tells me newer apps which use alsa sound better (alsaplayer, xmms
with alsa module) to my ear.

The 2 things that trick people are the modules.conf file, they didn't have that
automatic matrix page when I started with alsa, you don't know how good you have it.

And on my old installs (only the first time I installed it on a clean box), alsa
always was ""muted"" until you fire up a mixer and turn up the music. It's possible
Matthias even took care of that too. Anyway it is/was only a one time thing on 1st
install, that was a long time ago for me.

Those ALSA dudes had been trying to get it into the 2.4 kernel but missed it, but
it's been in 2.5 for a while now, so alsa is the future of sound in the linux kernel.

I think some of the more interesting notes are that it will include ""a

Well, I mentioned classifier and tokenize only because I thought they were

Without addressing the overpopulation argument, the more bureaucracy,
the more opportunity for corruption. If a corporation is corrupt,
there are generally, absent more government intervention,
alternatives. With bureacracy that is more difficult; one generally

G] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2,"Folks,
 
my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.

 
Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.
 
I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net), but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?
 
Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.
 
If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.
 
Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat? Opinions
welcome.
 
Thanks a lot,

Disappearing Alliance,"http://www.techcentralstation.com/1051/printer.jsp?CID=1051-100802B



The Disappearing Alliance
By Dale Franks 10/08/2002


For over two generations, the countries of Western Europe have been our
closest allies. We stood beside each other through the darkest days of the
Cold War as partners in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. We
celebrated with them over the fall of the Soviet Empire and the liberation
of Eastern Europe from the yoke of communism.

Tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries.

Europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that
Hudson Institute scholar John Fonte has termed ""progressive
transnationalism"". The key doctrines of this form of post-communist
progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. Among these are the
deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of post-nationalist ideas of
citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and
the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the
United Nations.

The European Union, itself a multinational organization built through the
pooling of sovereignty by European nations, is post-democratic. While there
is a European Parliament, the EU's power resides mainly in the unelected
European Commission (EC) and its unelected President, who face few limits
to their power. Instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where
elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the EU has an
appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy,
whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. Moreover,
the EU has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of
the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired
by the EU's political elite. Both the EC and the European Court of Justice
regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected EU member
governments. This is a step backward in Europe's political development.

European criticism of America is on the rise, and the European list of
complaints about America is a long and growing one. They dislike the fact
that our republican system of government is not based on proportional
representation. They hate the fact that our citizens own guns. They despise
the fact that we execute murderers. They resent the fact that our economy
is so large, and that Americans consume so much. They also resent?and fear
- the fact that we have the ability to project American power anywhere
in the world.

On August 9, 2002, Adrian Hamilton wrote a column in the UK's Independent
newspaper, in which he identified the US as a rogue state who should be
restrained, perhaps by a European military invasion, followed by a decade
or so of occupation. Fortunately, the article is satirical not because it
exaggerates the way European progressives view the US, but rather because
the impotence of European military power makes the idea of an invasion of
the US literally fantastic.

At least, for now.

Despite the tongue-in-cheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact
remains that America is increasingly viewed this way by the European
intellectual and political elite.

The Europeans actively desire a world where the United Nations keeps in
check the activities of sovereign states. Because they have built such a
system in Europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. America,
however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. The Europeans cannot
understand why America places a higher value on the ethos of national
sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it
does on compliance with international ""norms."" They view all departures
from such norms as aberrant. Because the UN member states all have an equal
vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the
process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. The trouble
with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of non-democratic,
authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic
societies. It sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results.

Thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the US refusals
to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the
liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from Iraq because its
dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. Our repeated references
to the US Constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to
comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. They assume,
therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a
commitment to
constitutional rights.

None of this bodes well for the future of Euro-American friendship, or
cooperation. If the Europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in
favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the US will rise, while
their tolerance of our differences will fall. Obviously, in such a
political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably
increase.

That thought is frightening enough. Even more frightening, however, is the
thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the
new ideology of transnational progressivism.

Parted is your friend! You can't do _everything_, the most limiting being
that you can't move the start of a partition, but it's quite powerful
nevertheless, and I've been very happy with it the few times I've had to

You're really better off backuping all placed where you know you've hand
edited or installed some files. For me that's only /etc/, /root/ and
/home/. Then you reinstall cleanly, formating ""/"", put your /home/ files
back into place and you're ready to go.
That's the moment I usually realize I had a nifty tweak to a file in
/etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ or some special parameters added to an
/etc/modules.conf entry... so I look at my backup and make the same change
again. The only thing where you can get stuck is the grub.conf files,
because although there's a /etc/grub.conf link, it's actually in
/boot/grub/ so you may want to copy it too if you have special kernel
parameters to save (I have to pass ""pci=bios,biosirq"" for one of my
computers to work for example).

I'd just like to recommend the newest Viz to ukers just for the hilarious ""David

trying to escape.  Several times he seems to have escaped and the british 
officers celebrate before it's revealed he's been buried alive or hiding in a 
freezer.  At one point he's asked why and says ""Well it's not for publicity""

Hi, Ben,

it seems, the RH freetype package should be repacked,
see for this
https://bugzilla.redhat.com/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=74415

Please, can you atach and send your sucessfully rebuild of the RH freetype

Subject: [ILUG] Newbie seeks advice - Suse 7.2


Folks,

my first time posting - have a bit of Unix experience, but am new to Linux.


Just got a new PC at home - Dell box with Windows XP. Added a second hard
disk
for Linux. Partitioned the disk and have installed Suse 7.2 from CD, which
went
fine except it didn't pick up my monitor.

I have a Dell branded E151FPp 15"" LCD flat panel monitor and a nVidia
GeForce4
Ti4200 video card, both of which are probably too new to feature in Suse's
default
set. I downloaded a driver from the nVidia website and installed it using
RPM.
Then I ran Sax2 (as was recommended in some postings I found on the net),
but
it still doesn't feature my video card in the available list. What next?

Another problem. I have a Dell branded keyboard and if I hit Caps-Lock
twice,
the whole machine crashes (in Linux, not Windows) - even the on/off switch
is
inactive, leaving me to reach for the power cable instead.

If anyone can help me in any way with these probs., I'd be really grateful -
I've searched the 'net but have run out of ideas.

Or should I be going for a different version of Linux such as RedHat?
Opinions
welcome.

Thanks a lot,
Peter

That's another argument for a ""HLL"" (Habeas Licensee List) which would be less
inclusive than a test for the mark of for HIL, but more timely and accurate. When an
ip address is on the HLL it could get a huge negative score, bigger than the Habeas

Date: 2002-10-08T20:52:08-05:00

Movable Type 2.5 is out. I'm running it and it appears to work. It incorporates 
many suggestions from Dive Into Accessibility[1], a book which was written in 
and is still powered by Movable Type. I find this amusing in a self-referential 
sort of way. 

The other big change is the inclusion of MT-search to allow users to have their 
own site search. Every web site needs a site search[2]. Existing MT-search 
users should merge the contents of mt-search.cfg into mt.cfg, change 
""TemplateDir"" to ""SearchTemplatePath"", and (if you use alternate templates) 
change ""AltTemplate1"", ""AltTemplate2"", ""AltTemplate3"", etc. to ""AltTemplate"". 
They should all just be ""AltTemplate"". 

- Download MT 2.5[3].

More detail please?  I do use sequences, so I'm familiar with their

You're probably running exmh on a local machine.  I'm running it on

Not yet -- still working on the required config changes.  But I have a

It will!  Part of my cunning plan involves something like this:

  if folder == ""accepted"":             # ie. not suspected junk mail
      if (len(recipients) == 1 and
          recipients[0] in (""guido@python.org"", ""barry@python.org"", ...)):
          folder = ""personal""

If you (and Guido, Barry, et. al.) prefer, I could change that last
statement to ""folder = None"", so the mail won't be saved at all.  I
*might* also add a ""and sender doesn't look like -bounce-*, -request,
-admin, ..."" clause to that if statement.

I believe the SpamAssassin maintainers have a scheme whereby the corpus
of non-spam is distributed, ie. several people have bodies of non-spam
that they use for collectively evolving the SA score set.  If that
sounds vague, it matches my level of understanding.

d museums of NYC,"URL: http://boingboing.net/#85524596
Date: Not supplied

Great Village Voice story about oddball museums in New York. My favorite 
weird-ass museum is the Museo de Criminologia in San Jose, Costa Rica, which 
has bits of victims of famous crimes (machete-dented brain-pans, severed arms, 
etc) floating in formaldehyde jars. 

    A stone's throw away is the singular Freakatorium, El Museo Loco, a classy 
    treasure chest of curiosities belonging to sword swallower Johnny Fox, 
    whose focus is the rich history of America's earliest museums, from P.T. 
    Barnum's American Museum to the Bowery Dime Museums. The walrus penis bone 
    (other penis bones on display: coyote, mink, fox, raccoon) is enough to 
    make you feel you're getting your $5 worth. But then you spy the Jivaro 
    Shrunken Head (it's real, it's the size of a tennis ball); conjoined 
    piglets in a jar; an assload of taxidermy, including a gorgeous zebra head; 
    giant's rings...

Yes, I looked at ""fixing"" it there, but that code is really quite
general, with almost no understanding of what anything means, so I
didn't think that corrupting it with knowlwedge of the semantics of
what it is fetching would really be the best thing to do.

I ran out of time last night while looking for a better place for
a similar check (I would have gone directly to the regexp - I'm not
that up to date with all the latest tcl changes...) and I'm not sure
I will have time today, but I will keep looking.

Sorry about that,
procmail is run by the qmail delivery agent to presort all mail
I get.
But anyway, I found an error message in procmail.log, which solved
the problem.
The following line in my delivery script seems to work fine now:

The timtest module seems to contain an enormous body of practical
knowledge about how to parse mail messages, but the module wasn't
designed for re-use.  I'd like to see a module that can take a single
message or a collection of messages and tokenize each one.

I'd like to see the tokenize by customizable, too.  Tim had to exclude
some headers from his test data, because there were particular biases
in the test data.  If other people have test data without those
biases, they ought to be able to customize the tokenizer to include

Requiring a file that isn't part of an rpm is not possible, no, except
maybe by stopping the build process if it isn't found... but that's errr...
ugly!
And I really think that for people who installed a kernel from sources, the
easiest is to install the alsa kernel drivers from source too...

This would be a tricky one since to use the ""--with <name>"" feature of
rpmbuild, I think you'd need to add individual handling of each and every
card :-/

That's what the ""alsa-driver"" is there for, create all the base files
excluding the kernel drivers. What I would suggest for dependency reasons
it to install an ""alsa-kernel"" for the original kernel (you've kept it,
right? ;-)) and install ALSA modules from source for custom kernels built
from source.

Indeed : The rpm 4.1 snapshot in (null) has a few new features among which
having the build fail when files are present in the build root but not
listed in the %files section. I should remove them manually as part of the
build process... or maybe the new ""%exclude /path/to/file"" in the %files
section would do, but I don't know how older versions of rpm would handle
it. On my (null) build system, I've simply set the variable :
%_unpackaged_files_terminate_build 0

Get Sexier, Keep Husbands, Mayor Tells Wives
Wed Sep 4, 9:14 AM ET

MISSAGLIA, Italy (Reuters) - Husband's eyes wandering? Make yourself sexier.
At least that's the solution proposed by an Italian mayor -- and a woman
mayor at that.

Wives in the northern town of Missaglia had complained to mayor Marta
Casiraghi about a young woman who sunbathed topless on her terrace.

They complained that the men in the town of some 7,000 people were spending
too much time ogling, so they asked Casiraghi to order the woman to put her
clothes back on.

But the mayor, far from sympathizing, told the wives to get sexy if they
wanted to keep their men. ""The girl was very pretty and was soaking up some
sun. Topless sunbathing is largely tolerated and widespread nowadays.
There's nothing we can do,"" Casiraghi told Il Nuovo, a web-based newspaper.

""Instead, I'd advise the wives to play their rival at her own game -- make
themselves more beautiful.""

Yea, and that on top of the 100x of all the parsing engines over just

Political mail (the snail kind) doesn't bother me.  I like it a lot of the

get information.

but what matters is that mail is speech, and political email has to be as
well protected as any other political speech.  Spam is *the* tool for
dissident news, since the face that it's unsolicited means that recipients
can't be blamed for being on a mailing list.

Nabs Storage Startup - buys Pirus Networks,"
Related to the MS acquisition of XDegrees?

==
http://www.internetnews.com/infra/article.php/1466271

Sun Nabs Storage Startup
By Clint Boulton
Amid the flurry of news at its own SunNetwork 2002 conference in San
Francisco, Sun Microsystems Thursday said it has agreed to purchase data
storage concern Pirus Networks for an undisclosed amount of stock.

The Palo Alto, Calif. networking firm bought the Acton, Mass.-based startup
with a keen eye for the startup's switching (define) devices and
virtualization technology. Used as part of a storage area network (define),
virtualization is the pooling of storage from many network storage devices
into what appears to the operating system to be a single storage device that
is managed from a central console.

Though major vendors make similar technology, Pirus competes with the likes
of Rhapsody Networks and Confluence Networks. Sun plucked Pirus after
scouting some 65 companies.

Mark Lovington, vice president of marketing for Pirus, told internetnews.com
that Pirus and Sun have been in discussion for a while about a possible
acquisition. Pirus, he said, succeeded in a goal it shares with a lot of
storage startups -- to be acquired by one of the major systems vendors, such
as Sun IBM, HP, Hitachi.

""This is a huge opportunity for Pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7
or 8 system-level players,"" Lovington said. ""Sun sees this acquisition as a
critical element to their N1 initiative. The synergies were quite obvious.""

N1 is Sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define)
architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a
role in a computation problem or information processing. N1 is being styled
as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and
networks as a single system -- at a lower cost and with greater flexibility.

While lagging behind other, more entrenched players, Sun is gaining ground
in the storage market with its Sun StorEdge Complete Storage Solutions,
according to a new report by IDC. John McArthur, group vice president of
IDC's Storage program, said Sun Microsystems and IBM posted the largest
increases in total storage revenue over Q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains,
respectively. As of Q2, Sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of
$411 million.

Sun's acquisition of Pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of
Sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends December 29, 2002.

That got a good laugh out of me.   Just saying ""crucial hair feature""

I've done a fair amount of thinking about the ""media intermediated"" meeting

One is both rejected for trivial reasons and rejects for the same.
Some people loudly defend that these choices are not trivial.

I'd have never met my best friend if I had to pick her out of a crowd for 
getting to know.   I was a teen at the time, but I won't say I'm much 
improved at being able to spot ""interesting"" at a distance.   Interesting 
isn't an external thing.  I have that brought home to me again every so 
often.  I may think that interesting people dress differently or whatever, 
but that's total superstition.   How do I know what your version of 
creative attire is?  Maybe it's purely functional.

I was at a loud party recently, sufficiently loud that conversation of any 
kind was extremely difficult, and intoxication was the norm.   I was 
working on what my algorithm for meeting people there should be and one of 
the candidates was ""women, in order of attractiveness.""   I flinched from 
that, rather violently.   At a trade show, or something, I might elect to 
talk to the people who are looking at interesting exhibits.   At a 
party.....well, if you can't hear the conversation they are having, or if 
on the net all you have is a photo.....

You just can't tell important things from a picture and a few words.  It's 
not how we are built.   There's no geek code for the heart and soul.
(And if there were people would lie and game the system.)
It's too easy to say ""Oh, no!  He's a geek!""   or ""She's a CAT person, 
ick!"" when you might have a great time together.

We are constructed to form alliances based on how we fit together as 
people, how we feel in the other person's company, how well we partner on 
tasks and recreation.   This is all entirely speculative based on nothing 
but superstitious association unless you actually have time in the 
person's company.   Which is why we tend to be screwed when our circle of 
exposure shrinks after school.

Personally, as a writer, the whole internet meet & email thing ought to 
work better for me than it does for other people, but interestingly, it 
doesn't.   I have to put out the same amount of effort and reap about the 
same poor results.    I have to think it's not the people, but the tool.

An aside (okay, yes, I'm a tool geek):  Speed Dating
Speed Dating (aka 7 Minute Dating) is a live-action stab at actual time in

it's noticably better, but still absolutely nothing like working on a

It was, in fact, invented as a jewish thing seeking to match up the young 
people to avoid total assimilation.   It has too much ""interview"" context 
and no shared activity beyond that.   I give it several points for effort 
though. 

I guess my impression that even the Speed Dating thing doesn't do much for 
you means that the traditional advice of ""join activities groups"" is 
actually sound.

The absurdities of life.,"what takes time and money: noting the amounts of each correction and basing
the refund delivery method on the amount.  yesh, it's silly to spend $.37 (+
labor and materials) for a $.02 refund, but maybe the only alternative right
now is to create dichotomies that require even more time and labor - or keep
the money (see john hall below).  your mailed refund is a function of bulk.

in jax we're on the verge of firing at&t cable for horrible customer service
and over-charging.  what will probably happen: if the amount of overage per
customer is significant (say $30 or more) the refund will go directly to the
customer.  If it's less, the combined total amount will go to the city as
lump sum settlement.

in your case, maybe all the customers could vote on line where they'd like
their lump sum to go.  of courese, they'd have to be notified by mail first.

They are legally required to do that.  I got a similar check because an
insurance company didn't pay a claim quickly enough.  It might have been
$.02.

Although they spent lots more than $.33 to mail you the check, the
alternative seems to be to keep the money.  Do you really want companies
to have a financial incentive to over-bill you 'just a bit' so they
could keep it?  For a company with millions of customers, $.33/customer
starts adding up.

I never used ConfigParser before, but I read that its read() method silently
ignores files that don't exist.  If 'bayes.ini' isn't found, *none* of the
options will be defined.  Since you want to run this from a directory other
than my spambayes directory, it's up to you to check in changes to make that
possible <wink>.

ic mailing list sign up package,"Has anyone seen/heard of/used some package that would let a random person

of course let ppl sign up for the lists and manage their subscriptions.

The saying, as I recall, is along
the lines of ""put your best foot
forward"".

(In this case, you seem to have put
everything forward, in a Fosbury
Flop consisting of the best foot,
the worst foot, enough arms for a
diety and his consort, and even a
set of spare limbs from Hoffa or
the space aliens or whatever it is
you keep locked up in the trunk of
the Bonneville)

Pascal could write short letters,
when he had the time.  Is editing
to provide an ""executive summary""
really being untrue to yourself?

(We are all used to a full-bore
real-time Rohit streaming, but
that's because we are already
""Friends of"", and know to set
our buffers accordingly.  For a
stranger's sake, it may be best
to provide the ""elevator pitch
Rohit"" -- and negotiate upwards
only after a session has been
established)

Why is it that I envision Verisign doing something like this.  Yeah, 
like I want Verisign to sign all my spam, er, mail for me.  Pay them 
enough and they'd probably sign spam too. ;)
